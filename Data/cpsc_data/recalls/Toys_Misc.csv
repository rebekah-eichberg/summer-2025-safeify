"Children's Outdoor Water Toy Corrected by Wham-O",3/10/1980 ,"Children's Outdoor Water Toy Corrected by Wham-O NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 10, 1980 Release # 80-007 Wham-O To Correct Potential Hazard In Children's Outdoor Water Toy WASHINGTON, D.C. (March 10)-- A program to correct more than 100,000 outdoor Fun Fountain water toys which may cause serious injuries to children is being conducted by the Wham-O Mfg. Co. of San Gabriel, California. The firm, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, voluntarily will supply free corrective water flow control valve inserts for its Fun Fountain toys produced from 1977 through November, 1979. The toy consists of a clown hat and head which attaches onto the end of a garden hose so that the hat rises in the air when water flows through the clown's head. Children may be inclined to peer into the water outlet and the stream of water could cause serious eye injuries, especially in communities with high water pressure. CPSC so far has been informed of two consumer complaints since June, 1979, involving a six-year-old boy and a seven-year- old boy who suffered eye injuries when struck at close distance by water emitted from the Fun Fountain toys. The Wham-O Fun Fountain water toys were sold nationwide in toy stores and variety stores for approximately $10.00 each. The model number of the toy, #237, is imprinted on the toy's package. According to the company, the potential hazard has been corrected on all Fun Fountain toys manufactured since December, 1979 when the toys began to be produced with a water flow control valve to decrease and control the water flow. Such new editions are readily identifiable since they are equipped with a blue hose connector (the older design has a red connector) at the base of the clown head. The words Important Notice and Safety Check List also are imprinted on the new toy cartons. If the hose connector is red but contains a blue insert which is clearly visible, then it also has been corrected and is equipped with a water flow control valve. To correct the potential hazard in Fun Fountain toys manufactured before December, 1979, parents are urged to go to the place of purchase to receive a free water flow control valve insert, or they may contact Wham-O directly to receive a free valve insert (Customer Service Dept. 7, 835 East El Monte Street, San Gabriel, California, 91778). Consumers also may telephone Wham-O toll-free at 800/423-4174 (in California, call collect at 213/287-9681). The water flow control valve snaps easily into the hose connector and once installed will remain firmly within the connector, according to the company.",80007,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1980/Wham-O-To-Correct-Potential-Hazard-In-Childrens-Outdoor-Water-Toy

Approximately 2 1/2 million of these toys have been sold throughout the United States over the past 17 years.

The toy is designed to be attached to a garden hose for water fun. It retails for approximately $3.50. Wham-O stated that the recall is occasioned by the death of a four-year-old child in March 1978.

"Play Brooms Recalled by Come Play Products Company",8/28/1986 ,"Play Brooms Recalled by Come Play Products Company NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR RELEASE August 28, 1986 Release # 86-54 Play Brooms Recalled Because Of Lead Paint Hazard Washington, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Come Play Products Company of Worcester, Massachusetts today announced a voluntary recall of children's brooms because paint on the brooms' handles contains an excess of lead. Since 1960, Come Play has imported 100,000 of these brooms from Hungary and sold them nationwide for about $2.50 retail value through variety stores nationally. The brooms are approximately 28 inches long, with natural straw bristles. The handles are painted red. On the handle the word HUNGARY is stamped in gold-colored letters. This recall does not apply to Brooms with plastic handles and plastic bristles. The Consumer Product Safety Commission knows of one incident involving a child who had ingested paint from the broom's handle but was unable conclusively to attribute the child's elevated blood lead level to the toy. CPSC regulations limit paint on consumer products to .06%. The CPSC found that the paint on the brooms' handles contained an excess of lead many times the legal amount. The brooms are therefore banned. If a child gnaws or sucks on an article coated with lead-containing paint and ingests the paint, the lead will enter the child's bloodstream. The Commission and Come Play Products Company urge teachers and parents to remove these brooms from use immediately and either discard them or return them for a refund to the retailer where purchased. Retailers should remove the brooms from their shelves and return them to Come Play Products Company, 44 Suffolk Street, Worcester, Massachusettes, 01604.",86054,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1986/Play-Brooms-Recalled-Because-Of-Lead-Paint-Hazard
