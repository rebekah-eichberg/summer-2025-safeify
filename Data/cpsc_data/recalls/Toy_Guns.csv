"Blow-Gun Toys Recalled by Western",10/26/1979 ,"Blow-Gun Toys Recalled by Western NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 26, 1979 Release # 79-060 Wisconsin Manufacturer Agrees To Recall 180,300 Blow-Gun Toys WASHINGTON, D.C. (Oct. 26) -- Approximately 180,000 Soft Shot Star Launcher blow-gun toys which may pose a choking hazard to children are being recalled voluntarily by their manufacturer, the Western Publishing Company, of Racine, Wisconsin. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The toy consists of a white plastic tube and mouthpiece which measure approximately 29 inches in overall length. It is sold with three small cardboard targets and three orange darts molded of soft vinyl, each approximately three inches long. The company is recalling the toys based on consumer reports since July, 1979, of three children who choked on the toy's mouthpiece. In each instance, the mouthpiece reportedly separated from the plastic tube and lodged in the child's throat. No critical injury or illness resulted from any of these incidents, according to the company. A fourth similar incident was reported to CPSC and is being investigated by Commission staff. The company reported to CPSC that, despite the potential hazard, the toy meets or exceeds all existing voluntary product safety standards. Model number 4990 is printed on the toy's package, although the toy itself and its components do not display any distinguishing identification. Manufactured and distributed earlier this year, the toy sold for approximately $2 in toy stores and other variety retail stores nationwide. The manufacturer has directed all retailers and distributors of the toys to stop sales. Parents should return the toy to the retailer from which it was purchased to receive a cash refund. Consumers also can obtain refunds (including reimbursement for postage costs) by mailing the toys to: Western Publishing Company, 1220 Mound Avenue, Racine, Wisconsin, 53404, Attention: Customer Relations Director.",79060,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1979/Wisconsin-Manufacturer-Agrees-To-Recall-180300-Blow-Gun-Toys
"Toy Cork Gun Recalled",2/5/1979 ,"February 5, 1979 Release # 79-007 Toy Cork Gun Recalled WASHINGTON, D.C. (Feb. 5) -- Eagle Family Discount Stores, Inc., Opa Locka, Fla., in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), today warned consumers that about 5,844 double-barreled toy cork shotguns sold in their stores during the 1976 and 1977 Christmas seasons may present a hazard of eye injury to a young child. Consumers who have bought one of these toys should not let their children play with it, and should return it to their nearest Eagle Family Discount Store for a full refund. CPSC believes that serious eye injury could occur if a child abuses the toy by removing the muzzle end of the gun barrel, exposing the ends of two metal rods covered with plastic plunger caps. These caps can be removed by a force of three or four pounds, leaving the ends of the metal rods completely exposed. If the toy gun is cocked and discharged, the exposed ends of the metal rods could then be propelled forward into a child's face or eyes. The double-barreled toy cork shotgun retailed for about $1.27 in Eagle Family Discount Stores located in Florida and in a few stores in Alabama and Georgia, according to Eagle. The words, Gun Fighter, appear in silver on each side of the toy gun. The stock is colored brown, the gun barrels are black and the cocking lever is chrome-colored plastic. The toy gun was made in Hong Kong or Taiwan, according to Eagle, and was identified as product no. 97-S-510,, which appears on the toy gun's package. To date, CPSC is aware of one incident of eye injury occurring when a three and one-half year-old boy apparently shot the toy gun into his eyes and was struck by the unprotected metal rod. Although the injury occurred to a three and one-half year old, the product's package contains, according to Eagle, a cautionary statement that the toy shotgun is not recommended for children under five years of age. To verify the product number, consumers can call the toll-free CPSC Hotline on 800/638-2772",79007,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1979/Toy-Cork-Gun-Recalled

"Toy Cork Rifles Recalled by F.J. Strauss",8/9/1979 ,"Toy Cork Rifles Recalled by F.J. Strauss NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 9, 1979 Release # 79-037 Toy Cork Rifles Recalled WASHINGTON, D.C. (Aug. 9) -- The F. J. Strauss Company, Inc., an importer and distributor with headquarters in New York City, is voluntarily recalling approximately 3,600 toy cork rifles because they may injure children's eyes. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission. According to CPSC staff, children run the risk of serious eye injuries if they remove the gun's muzzle and fire toward their faces, an action which could drive two interior metal rods into their eyes. These pushrods, which serve to expel the cork from the toy I normally are protected from extending to their full 8-inch length by small plastic barriers. However, some barriers may be positioned improperly, allowing the metal rods to project completely when the trigger is pulled. While F. J. Strauss never has received a complaint about the toy, CPSC received a report earlier this year that a 3+year-old boy suffered eye injuries from an identically constructed toy cork gun made by another manufacturer; all of these models have since been recalled. Strauss has told CPSC that other firms also have distributed identical toy guns. The cork guns have been marketed since 1977 in cardboard boxes which are labeled F. J. Strauss Co., Inc., New York, New York, 10010. The cartons also are labeled with the trademark Straco, and with Western Double-Barrel Cork Rifle. They sold for approximately $1.99 at various retail outlets.

"Plastic Ring Caps For Toy Guns Recalled by Acme Specialties",6/29/1979 ,"Plastic Ring Caps For Toy Guns Recalled by Acme Specialties NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 29, 1979 Release # 79-031 Plastic Ring Caps For Toy Guns Recalled WASHINGTON, D.C. (June 29) -- The Acme Specialties Corporation, an importer of novelty items in River Grove, Illinois, today announced a voluntary recall of thousands of Three Stars plastic ring caps which may accidentally explode causing serious burns to the user. This announcement was made in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The ring caps are commonly used in toy guns to produce a loud report when the trigger is pulled. Each cap consists of a plastic disc measuring 1 1/2 inches in diameter, and 8 cap charges which are positioned within small plastic cups around the outer edge of the disc. The charges are made with a small amount of friction-sensitive pyrotechnic material which is formed into l/8-inch pellets. According to CPSC staff and the firm, the charged pellets can accidentally fall out of their protective cups and may explode without warning , possibly resulting in serious burns to the user. In some instances, the caps fired while in children's pockets. Since mid-June this year, at least five children reportedly have received first and second-degree burns when the caps exploded unexpectedly, according to CPSC staffers. One other child reportedly was burned in February, 1979. The ring caps are sold six-to-a-set in Clear plastic packages which are labeled, Three Stars Plastic Ring Caps and Made in Taiwan. They primarily have been marketed in the Midwest by 5-and-10-cent stores, including Walgreens, and various other retailers since 1978. The caps are most frequently sold as a separate item. However, they often appear on display shelves near toy cap guns. Parents are advised to return all such caps immediately to the retailer for a full refund. Consumers should take extra care to avoid skin contact with the caps, and they should not carry the caps in their pockets. Anyone who is unsuccessful getting a refund may contact Lawrence Callan of Acme Specialties Corporation by calling 312/453-7121.
