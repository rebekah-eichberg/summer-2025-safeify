The models in question were shipped into commerce before May 1, 1977. Ghey bear a single staple which fastens the club rod to the handle. Consumers who have purchased the model 721 or 723 toy golf clubs are urged to carefully examine them to make sure the rod is securely attached to the handle. If the connection is weak, consumers are instructed to discontinue use and may return the clubs to their retailer for refund or replacement. The toy golf clubs are packaged in pairs along with two golf balls on a cardboard backing labeled Par Golf and H-G Toys. No identifying markings appear on the clubs or balls themselves. The model 721 and 723 clubs were distributed nationwide and retail from about $1.50 to $2.50 in specialty and variety stores. It is currently not known how many of the toy clubs are still available for purchase by consumers since the products were marketed primarily for sale during the summer season.
