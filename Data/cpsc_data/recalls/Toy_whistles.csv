Recalls Siren Whistle Toy Because Of Potential Choking Hazards WASHINGTON, DC -- Toys R Us, Inc. of Paramus, New Jersey is voluntarily recalling 9,600 Siren Whistle toys because they may pose a potential choking hazard to young children.

The product is identified as Siren Whistles, Lucky Star Enterprises, #69096 (SKNO81825) and Unique Industries, #8848 (SKNI85892), made in Taiwan.

While neither CPSC nor Toys R Us, Inc. is aware of any injuries associated with the toy, this corrective action is being taken to prevent the possibility.
