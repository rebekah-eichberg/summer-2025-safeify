(December 3) -- A children's stuffed animal sold nationwide as the Squeeze Me Bear is being recalled by the importer in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission because the toy may present safety hazards which could injure young children. An estimated 53,000 Squeeze Me Bears have been sold since 1979 at retail Prices averaging from $7 to $8 each. The toy bears were manufactured in Taiwan and distributed to various toy stores and other retail outlets by the Atlanta Novelty Co. of Long Island City, New York. The potentially hazardous toys bear the product code number of either 291 or 298. Testing by CPSC of a random sample of the bears showed that one of the bears contained a potentially hazardous sharp wire in the stuffing, leading CPSC staff to believe that a significant portion of the other Squeeze Me Bears in stores and consumers homes also may contain such wires; a similar recall of another importer's brand of stuffed animals was initiated less than a month ago. The potential danger lies in the possibility that the wire may work its through the bear's fur. So far there have been no injuries reported to CPSC. In addition, during CPSC testing which simulated normal use and abuse of the toy by a young child, some noses of the bears fell off, thus posing a potential choking hazard to young children. Accordingly, these stuffed toys have been determined to be banned hazardous substances under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Consumers are being urged to return their Squeeze Me Bears to the retailer where the toy was purchased for a full refund.

(October 31) -- The highly popular Pot Belly line of children's stuffed animals is being recalled by the importer in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission because the toys may present hazards which could injure young children. More than five million of the five different types of Pot Bellies have been sold nationwide in a variety of sizes since late in 1978. Pot Bellies are distributed to more than 2,800 toy stores, department stores and other retailers by the Daekor division of Hudson Brands, Ltd., of New York City. CPSC has received a number of consumer complaints of small wires protruding from the toy animals; however, there have been no reports of serious injuries to date. Testing by CPSC revealed that a substantial percentage of the toys tested contained sharp wires in the stuffing. When tested under the terms of a CPSC regulation designed to prevent children under the age of three years from swallowing and choking on small parts of toys, some of the Pot Bellies failed the test. Accordingly, these stuffed toys -- until inspected by the importer to ensure their safety -- have been determined to be banned hazardous substances under the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. Once inspected and found free of wires, the toys may be distributed. CPSC also discovered through testing that the bean bag variety of smaller Pot Bellies presents another hazard in addition to the potential presence of small wires. The bottoms of bean bag Pot Bellies are stuffed with crushed walnut shells which could be swallowed by children if the toy animals come apart at the seams (as some did during the CPSC testing). Consumers are being urged to return their Pot Belly stuffed animals to the retailer where the toy was purchased for a full refund or replacement. Pot Bellies have been sold at retail prices ranging from $8 to $30, depending on their size. Refunds only are being offered to consumers who return bean bag Pot Bellies to the retailer. (The importer also has distributed about 5,000 large Pot Belly koala bears and brown bears which are not being subjected to the ban or the recall. These 40-inch-long bears were manufactured by a Brooklyn, N.Y., company which used a different stuffing material.) Hudson Brands will alert each retailer to the hazards and the procedures to be followed in carrying out the recall and inspection program, and also will inspect all further shipments of these toy animals to ensure that there are no wires in the stuffing.",80039,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1980/Millions-Of-Pot-Belly-Toy-Animals-Being-Recalled-To-Eliminate-Safety-Hazards

Stuffed Animal Mobiles Recalled by Calderon,9/10/1987,"Stuffed Animal Mobiles Recalled by Calderon NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE September 10, 1987 Release # 87-048 Stuffed Animal Mobiles Recalled Because Of Strangulation Hazard - Recent Death Cited WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, Calderon Company, Inc., Locust Valley, New York, is recalling its large stuffed animal mobiles. When hung within the reach of an infant, a 26-inch nylon cord poses the potential for entanglement and strangulation. The Commission and the firm are aware of the September 1986 fatal strangulation accident of a 15-month-old Pennsylvania boy. The boy became entangled in the nylon cord attached to the wings of a Toucan model which was hung over a crib and post. A label sewn into the mobile, warning against use by children under three, had been removed after purchase. Other models of the colorful, soft, stuffed animal mobiles include giraffes, pelicans, elephants, ducks, and penguins. The recalled mobiles may be identified by a cloth label sewn into the stuffed toy. It bears the words CALDERON CO, INC., CONTENTS: ALL NEW MATERIAL, PLUSH AND FILLING (FILLING: POLYSTER FIBER & PLASTIC PELLERS) NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN UNDER 3 YEARS OF AGE) MADE IN TAIWAN .  A nylon cord about 26 inches long attaches to one wing, arm, or ear, passes through a white ring connecting two springs, and then attaches to the other wing, arm, or ear (see attached sketch). This allows the wings, arms, or ears to flap as the animal bounces up and down. It also makes a squeaking noise as it bounces or is handles. Approximately 16,000 of these mobiles were imported from Taiwan and sold nationwide since 1979. The large stuffed mobiles retail for about $10.00. Consumers should take the mobiles away from children and cut the 26-inch nylon cord and springs. Send the detached cord and sprints to: Calderon Co., Inc., 480 Forest Avenue, Locust Valley , NY 11560. Calderon will send you a free plush toy in return.
