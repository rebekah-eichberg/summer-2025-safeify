However, there have been three reports of suffocation from infant head or neck entrapment between the steps of the ladder of a play gym similar in appearance, but not sold by Sears and not manufactured by American Toy & Furniture.

It consists of a hollow box, made of fiberboard and wood about 30 inches high which supports a two-step wooden ladder on one side held in place by two brackets and a short slide on the other.

"Creative Playthings Renews Efforts To Replace Indoor Gym House Ladders After California Death",3/15/1982 ,"Release # 82-008 WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Creative Playthings had renewed its efforts to replace all estimated 137,000 to 239,000 Creative Playthings Indoor Gym House ladders following a recent strangulation death. The product was manufactured prior to 1980 by Creative Playthings, a unit of Gabriel Industries, a division of CBS Inc., New York, N.Y. Consumers are urged to remove and destroy the ladder immediately. The replacement program was conducted in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission which advised the firm of the death of a two-year-old California boy on February 9, 1982, in an accident associated with a Creative Playthings Indoor Gym House. The firm first took corrective action for the product in February, 1980, after learning of an accidental death and an incident causing brain damage which later resulted in death to a child playing with the product. The firm then urged owners of the product to obtain a free replacement ladder because the original ladder posed a strangulation hazard. The Creative Playthings Indoor Gym House consists of a hollow, fiberboard-and-wood box 20 inches in height which supports a two-step wooden ladder on one side and a short slide on the opposite side. The top of the box or platform serves as a bridge between the ladder and the slide and is protected on two sides by wooden railings. The product is intended for use by children ages 18 months through 3 l/2 years, according to the manufacturer. It was sold for approximately $29 to $50 in toy stores and other retail outlets nationwide in knocked-down form to be assembled by the owner. The ladder that was being replaced was manufactured from 1962 through 1979. The gym houses with ladders that were being replaced are those with Creative Playthings printed on the side or with no lettering. The space between the upper rung of the ladder and the platform was small enough for a child's head to be inserted and become entrapped creating a potential for strangulation. The replacement ladder that had been offered by the firm was redesigned to reduce the likelihood of head entrapment. The Creative Playthings company that conducted the recall no longer exists. The replacement ladders are no longer available, and consumers should discard or destroy the ladder if they have the product. Creative Playthings had undertaken additional efforts to advise owners to destroy the old ladder. The firm sent letters and posters to pediatricians and daycare centers throughout the United States, advertised in magazines, provided a public service announcement to major networks, aimed a news campaign to consumer affairs editors, and sent advisory bulletins to organizations serving parents of young children.

The Creative Playthings company that conducted the recall no longer exists. Please discard or destroy ladder. FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE Originally issued May 23, 1980; Last revised February 21, 2003 Release # 80-020 Creative Playthings Agrees To Recall 400,000 Potentially Hazardous Gym Sets WASHINGTON, D.C. (May 23) -- Approximately 400,000 Indoor Gym Houses are being recalled by their manufacturer, Creative Playthings, because they may pose a strangulation hazard to young children. Creative Playthings is a division of CBS, Inc., of New York, N.Y. The recall is being conducted voluntarily in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The gym houses consist of a hollow, masonite-and-wood box 30 inches in height which supports a two-step wooden ladder on one side and a short slide on the opposite side. The top of the box or platform serves as a bridge between the ladder and the slide and is protected on two sides by wooden railings. The product is intended for use by children ages 18 months through 3 years old, according to the manufacturer. It was designed to include a space between the upper rung of the ladder and the platform, which is small enough to enable children to trap their heads and potentially strangle or asphyxiate. CPSC staff has been informed of two incidents since October, 1979, in which young children entrapped their heads in the space as they sat facing the platform on the bottom rung of the ladder. One incident resulted in the strangulation of an 18-month-old baby girl. The other caused a 16-month-old boy to asphyxiate, resulting in irreversible brain damage. The gym houses being recalled were manufactured from 1962 through 1979 and were sold nationwide in toy stores and other retail outlets for approximately $29 to $50. Models manufactured before 1977 were constructed with a 6-inch space between the ladder's top rung and the platform, and models made after 1977 included a 5-inch space. The firm had redesigned all gym houses manufactured since January, 1980 with an expanded 7.5-inch distance between the platform and the upper rung of the ladder, greatly reducing the likelihood of head entrapment. The Creative Playthings company that conducted the recall no longer exists. The replacement ladder is no longer available. Consumers should discard or destroy the ladder if they still have this product.",80020,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1980/Creative-Playthings-Agrees-To-Recall-400000-Potentially-Hazardous-Gym-Sets
