WASHINGTON, DC -- CPSC, Fisher-Price, Inc., East Aurora, NY is announcing a recall program for its Snuggle Light dolls, model numbers 1372 and 1373, after learning of five instances of children choking or gagging on the doll's nightcap pom-pom. The program affects approximately 420,000 Snuggle Lights sold nationwide since February 1992. The company has received no reports of injuries as a result of this problem. The Snuggle Light is a doll whose face lights up when its body is squeezed. Fisher-Price has learned from consumers that very young children, primarily infants five to seven months old, can get the doll's pom-pom into their mouths and choke or gag on it. To eliminate this potential choking hazard, Fisher-Price is asking parents to cut off the pom-pom and the product label and send them to Fisher-Price, Consumer Affairs, 636 Girard Avenue, East Aurora, NY 14052. Fisher-Price will send a new Snuggle Light doll body (includes everything but light component) to consumers free of charge. If consumers have questions about this program, they can call Fisher-Price toll free at 1-800-233-4004 between 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time. Fisher-Price is asking that the dolls not be returned to retailers, but that consumers contact Fisher-Price for a new Snuggle Light doll body. Fisher-Price recently started shipping modified Snuggle Light dolls on which the cap is sewn to the doll's head and does not swing freely. This modification eliminates the possibility of a potential choking hazard.
