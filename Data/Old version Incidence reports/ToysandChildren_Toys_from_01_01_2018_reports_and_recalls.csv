Our contact email is listed on our website and we actively monitor our social media daily, so it is easy for consumers to reach us. The Wooden Dim Sum Toy has been tested frequently and routinely by independent laboratories and passes ASTM F963, CCPSA, EN71, and ISO 8124 –- toy standards referred to or mandated by most countries throughout the world. It has consistently passed all testing by CPSC certified laboratories. In addition, the product is appropriately labeled for children 3+ years old, both on its packaging and on our website. While we are very sorry to hear of the incident with this customer’s 1-year-old, as clearly stated on our website and packaging, our toy is intended for children ages 3 and up due to the handling of the wooden pieces. Although all of our wooden toy components are sized for essential safety and are more than 8% larger than the federal small part tube, the wear and tear and rougher play on a wooden toy by a child younger than 3 years of age can easily lead to excessive damage to toys made of wood. Over 3,000 units of this style have been sold since its inception. We checked our records and we have not had any other incident like this reported on this product. Despite this outstanding record, we strive to address any concerns reported to us. Therefore, we reviewed all our process controls, tests, and inspections to emphasize the important assembly steps, and we continue to follow our sound testing program for product compliance.  This customer also contacted us the day after the incident, and we immediately addressed her concerns and offered to mail her a replacement part as requested.  However, she requested the wrong piece, and when we offered to send another replacement piece per our terms of service listed on our website, we did not receive a follow-up response.",

Specifically, I request that the Commission:Require Amazon and the manufacturer to recall all toys that do not comply with the tracking label requirements.Impose appropriate penalties on Amazon and the manufacturer for violating the Consumer Product Safety Act.Ensure that all future products sold by Amazon and the manufacturer comply with all applicable safety regulations.Thank you for your attention to this matter.

At the store she loved it so how could I not give it a try, right? I removed the sales and she loved it from the second her hands touched it. Less than a week later we were just about to leave to go to the doctor's. I grabbed the toy thinking she liked it so much it would come in handy some we were on our way for her next round of vaccinations. As with all her toys I looked it over real quick to be safe. I noticed a rip in the seam which happened to be where one of the crinkle ears is attached to the main block. Upon closer inspection the small plastic film ( about 5.5mm by 4mm) was loose and came out. I'm am very relieved that I checked it before giving it to her because that is an extremely dangerous choking hazard that could have turned fatal.

The pieces of the toy (buttons, wheels, and plastic screws in packaging that got stuck in product) come undone immediately posing a chocking hazard.","Valencia",,91354,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Level of care not known","Male","My Child","2",,,,,,,,,"JOYIN INC: We learned from the report that the toys broke and produced small parts probably because the plastic screws on the packaging were difficult to twist open and parents forcibly removed the toys from the packaging. A 2-year and 8-month-old child participated in the demolition process and was injured by contact with broken parts. We are sorry to hear this but we have three points to make:1. The small parts are produced by adults in the process of removing the packaging, not by children in normal play. The injury caused by improper unpacking efforts is a random individual case with rare probability. 2. There is an age label and warning on the packaging, indicating that the car product is suitable for children over 3 years old. The probable cause of this case was the involvement of children below the applicable age in the dismantling process and the lack of adult supervision and protection. 3. The product has passed the US children's toy safety test and meets the standards (Please see the attached report for details). At the same time, we will also investigate the product to prevent similar incidents from happening. To sum up, the injuries caused by the simultaneous occurrence of three conditions: adults forcefully dismantled the packaging, and children below the warning age participated in the dismantling process without adult supervision, which is not enough to prove that there is a safety problem with the product itself.

My son developed a blister rash on his finger where he touched it.Upon inspection I realized the underside of the resin was unable to cure since there is no way for Uv light to penetrate through the opaque macaroni used. Therefore only the top layer of the resin was cured, while the bottom layer remained wet (this particular kit was completed months ago & cured under a UV light + was left out in the sun for several hours) I am aware that unused miniverse products have been recalled, but even some of the competed cured products still carry the a risk, since many use either opaque resin or products. We have checked our other completed miniverse toys & discovered several of the ones we have already completed (per the included instructions) still have  uncured resin: the popcorn bowl (resin under opaque popcorn top layer cannot cure), the holiday chocolate drink set & the appliance coffee set (only the top layer of the opaque brown resin is cured), the macaroons (only  outer edge of frosting was cured / resin in between opaque cookies remained uncured)I am sure there are many other sets (that we dont have) that are flawed as well. The utilization of opaque products is poorly designed, since it renders a complete UV curing process impossible.Due to this flawed design, I believe the current Miniverse  recall (for only unused kits) is insufficient.

The ribbon material frayed and she got partially tangled around her wrist and fingers and tried to eat the bits of removed finger tags. Baby was playing under supervision but everything happened very fast while turning head aside for parent to drink some water. Tiny bits of material had to be pried out of child's mouth. Website reviews report that fold material flakes off and other pieces are not well sewn on, but the toy was removed before finding out personally. Review with pictures left on website and message here immediately after.UPDATED ON 4/10/2023: [Toy is advertised for sale for one month and older; however, stitching of the looped material representing the toy's fingers and toes are not well sewn on, and the material not set deep enough within the material seams, such that infants are able to rip the bits of material out with normal mouthing actions. This also applies to the ribbon of material holding onto the attached star shaped chew toy. Within minutes of a first play session, the teether was almost removed from the toy's hand via a partially removed ribbon, and a toe ribbon was completely removed, fraying from most directions such that it tangled my child's hand, and she was feeling compelled to eat/mouth the stringy mess to try to free her hand. The shiny gold material also seems ready to rub off it chewed on.]","Metairie","Louisiana",70003,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Incident, No Injury","Female","My Child","1",Yes,No,,,,No,,"Straight from the box to the child's hands/mouth","",

I believe he warmed it for 120 seconds which IS above the time it should be warmed in the microwave although he had put it in for that same time on previous evenings without any issue.  After it was warmed, I noticed the smell, it smelled very odd and was not emitting the pleasant lavender scent that it is supposed to emit but rather a rancid and unpleasant odor.  My son was holding it and ready to head up to bed but because of the smell I took a moment to inspect the toy. There was a very faint trail of smoke coming through a small burn hole in the stuff animal and I realized that it was on fire - it was slowly smoldering inside the toy. I immediately put it into the sink and hosed it down with tons of water where there was tons of popping, sizzling, etc.  I'm grateful this was the extent of it and I am very concerned at the potential hazard to other children and families.

I couldn't remove the wheels, because they had an irreversible lock screw, so I couldn't easily access the bottom to unscrew it, and they also prevented me from prying apart the train all the way, making it difficult to unscrew. The tube was attached to an electrical panel for reading the blocks on one side. If she had been on the wrong side of the train, I wouldn't have been able to free her. Also, a couple screws inside of the train holding tube together were stripped, so I was only able to open one side of the tube.

I could not believe a professional immediately knew the answer, and casually mentioned lead in our children's toys as a very common issue.

I greatly fear if given to a child it could fracture small fingers or if placed in a childs mouth it could tear of a piece of a childs lip.

"," We’re sorry to hear your report of a Duracell C cell batteries becoming hot in the device you were using. We certainly understand your concern and want to assure you our batteries are extensively evaluated for safety and manufactured under strict quality controls. In fact, out of the hundreds of millions of batteries manufactured every year, Duracell receives few reports of this nature. We have reached out to the consumer but are unable to get the device and batteries for analysis.  Without examining both the batteries and the device, it’s difficult to know what could have caused the problem in this particular instance.  That said, our testing has shown that certain events may lead to batteries becoming hot, such as external shorting of the battery.  Another possible cause is incorrect placement of the batteries within the device. Inserting the batteries backwards can cause the batteries to form a negative discharge, again resulting in leakage, overheating or rupture. Evaluating the batteries and the device is the best way to understand the problem.  It’s important for us to be aware of any negative experiences with our products, so we thank you for reporting your concerns.Again, we regret you had this experience.

This happened to me and it started smoking heavily and melting the foam and the battery connector. The battery quickly got very hot. Luckily I was still holding the battery and I imminently realized what was happening and unplugged it before the battery itself exploded. This tells me two things, the battery connector is faulty and there is no polarity protection on the plane itself, which would have prevented this entirely. Polarity protection is industry standard.

The product is a hard plastic shark with a very sharp, pointed  nose.  When used as it was designed, the toy is thrown into the water and the plastic shark glides through the water. It causes a serious hazard to other swimmers in to pool due to the very sharp point on the nose of the shark. In this incident my younger son age 11 threw the toy shark into the water as my older son was swimming on the other side of the pool. The plastic shark collided into my son's forehead causing a laceration and profuse bleeding that needed emergency first aid to stop the bleeding and immediate medical treatment to close the laceration with sutures.

The ears of toy have a spring inside the ear attached to a motor, as it sings the ears move up and down to cover its eyes. This is to simulate peek a boo. So he is learning how to grab stuff and basically grabs anything in front of him. As he was grabbing the right ear with his left hand, all of a sudden a piece of metal was protruding from the ear. I immediately took pictures of how it looked in that moment, then i cut open the ear to investigate and found a piece of hot glue on that specific piece of metal. Like someone knew it could fail and that was the solution.... I have videos as well as pictures, luckily my child was not injured but I am concerned someones will be. The metal is part of this spring design that extended up into the ear itself in a loop fashion, with the end of the metal being held in place by the spring itself. That end of the loop metal if pushed upward can pop out and then pierce the fabric of elephant with ease. The power of the motor pushing the spring around i believe also contributes.

Thank you for notifying NSI International, Inc. of this incident –Report  20190819-43BAD-1896758  NSI International, Inc. has sold over 20 million patented Wubble Balls worldwide since 2014, and 1,000,000 Water Wubble water balloon balls (introduced in 2016). This is only the second report of a consumer “safety incident” received regarding Water Wubble water balloon balls (and  note that the first inquiry was actually not related to the product itself) and only the fifth inquiry in six years regarding safety of Wubble brand balls. Given the physical play of the product and the user base, we are certain you would agree that these are excellent statistics.All our products are tested to and in compliance with all applicable U.S and international safety standards. Copies of all these reports have been supplied under separate cover to the CPSC.  All of NSI International’s products, when used as instructed, are safe, durable, and fun.  Water Wubbles are unique in that they both reusable and refillable but intended to be played with as one would play with traditional water balloons.  .No injury was reported by the consumer. The consumer’s claim extends from what appears to be misuse/abuse and unsupervised use of the product by her child. The child filled the Water Wubble to an overly large and unmanageable size and proceeded to overextend the filling valve to insert his hand into the Water Wubble. The consumer claims that (as used by her child) the ball presents a drowning hazard because “this ball got so heavy it weighed her son down.”  It should be noted that the Water Wubble material has a specific gravity far less than 1.0.  With a specific gravity of less than 1.00, a Water Wubble, filled to maximum capacity with water, and placed in a body of water will remain neutrally buoyant or float.  Since it cannot sink, it could not have weighed her son down. This premise is physically impossible. In addition, nowhere in the included instruction sheet is such play pattern recommended, suggested, or even implied. In fact, the instruction sheet for NSI’s Water Wubble product clearly states “We recommend filling to a size that is comfortable to hold in your hand”. Nowhere in NSI-sponsored marketing and advertising is the product shown being filled/handled by a user to a size larger than a baseball, nor does it show or encourage users to insert hands or other extremities into the ball.  It is also important to note that NSI cannot control the water safety skills and/or the physical dexterity of our users.  Nor can we control the parental common sense which must dictate proper supervision of children at play – particularly in swimming pools or other bodies of water.  Had the consumer thoroughly consulted the included instructions, they would have noted that the manner the child was playing with the toy was inappropriate. It cannot be stressed enough that supervising adults should always demonstrate proper use of a toy when introducing it to a child.The report supplied to NSI International states that the consumer has not contacted us but plans to do so. The consumer did reach out to NSI via telephone and has spoken with our consumer service department.The consumer was advised and instructed by our consumer service representative on the proper play pattern for Water Wubbles.To reiterate, it is paramount that parental common sense must dictate as to supervising children at play in their specific environments, be it outdoors or indoors.Again, NSI International, Inc. takes the safety of our products and our consumers seriously (We’re all concerned parents too!) and it is our goal to provide 100% safe products and consumer satisfaction.

This resulted in an emergency room visit and daily doctor appts for 10+ days, including taking 6+ medicines for pain, steroids, and other eye drops.  I had to miss a full week of work and was limited to my bed for my eye to heal, as there was a severe risk due to the pressure of going permanently blind.  While my vision is back to normal, I run a high risk of glaucoma and have to get eye test twice a year for the rest of my life.My concern with this product is that Nerf implies safety.  If you look at the packaging and their marketing materials and commercials, the kids are having battles and are not wearing eye goggles.  the warnings are for choking only and a caution not to point at eyes or face.  Noting about recommending eye wear or promoting it in any way.In the past week, there is a report out of the UK, where they are now highlighting the dangers of nerf guns.  I have filed a report with Hasbro and their comments are they have been tested and are deemed safe as long as the guns are not modified or using non-branded nerf bullets.  This gun was not modified and we used the nerf elite bullets and sustained major injuries.Requesting the USPC to take action to require a change in how the nerf guns safety requirements are established from packaging to speed of the bullets.  I have spoken with Hasbro and other than taking down my information and sharing with their product team, they claim they are in compliance with the safety requirements and have no additional resources for me as the consumer to be an advocate in helping Hasbro make their products safer and to help reduce risk of others having the same injury.This week there was a report in the UK about 3 recent injuries that are similar to mine.  Action must be taken to protect our children.

We oiled his foot which didn’t work.

During my initial setup of this product, the main blades unexpectedly spun up to a very high rate of speed without warning, despite the throttle stick on the included T8 transmitter being in the lowest position. I believed the power cut switch to be in the position to disable the blades; however, I later learned that was not the case due to the absence of labeling on the transmitter switches. This incident resulted in multiple lacerations to my arm that required medical attention and out of pocket expenses. I believe this incident was due to several serious safety deficiencies with this product:1. Inadequate Instructions: The included Quick Start Guide did not adequately emphasize crucial safety precautions, such as the need to remove the blades during setup. Notably, this Ready To Fly kit does not include the tools necessary to remove the blades. Additionally, the Quick Start Guide provided unclear information about the transmitter's controls and the function of each switch on the transmitter. I learned after the incident that the position of these switches is critical in order to maintain control of the helicopter and prevent the main blades from inadvertently spinning. 2. Inadequate Safety Warnings: The product did not include sufficient warnings about the potential hazards of having the T8 transmitter switches in incorrect positions. After the incident, I learned that certain switch positions could cause the helicopter to spool up to high speed regardless of the throttle stick's position - an outcome that would not likely be anticipated by an ordinary person. 3. Absence of Labeling on the Transmitter: Most of the T8 transmitter switches were not labeled at all, and the included diagram did not clearly explain their multiple positions and functions. This lack of labeling led me to incorrectly believe that the power cut switch was in the safe position, directly contributing to the unsafe situation.These shortcomings contributed directly to my injuries, and I believe the product is unsafe as currently designed. I have found indications on the internet through videos and product reviews where other users of this product have expressed concerns over the inadequate instructions and the absence of labeling on the transmitter. To prevent similar incidents from occurring, I urge the Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate this product and require improvements, particularly to the instructions and transmitter labeling.

Do not put near or in nose or mouth. Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested. Speks meet all toy and safety standards and are safe with proper use by anyone over the age of 14. their magnetic flux index rating is less than 50, however Speks should never be put near or in your nose or mouth.In a 2015 CPSC safety standard for high-powered magnets, CPSC determined the standard should not apply to magnets with a flux index of less than 50. Speks has a flux index less than 50 and, therefore, would not have been subject to the CPSC’s safety standard and would not have been classified as a hazardous magnet as defined by CPSC and ASTM standards. The CPSC magnet standard was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for reasons unrelated to the flux index provision. Speks magnets are safe when used by adults as intended.Because Speks magnets are not marketed, promoted or intended for children, it is inaccurate and misleading for the CPSC to place the product in the Product Category “Toys & Children.” I ask that the product be removed from this category.",

She has not used it recently so I decided to put it up.  I initially disconnected the bottom fiberglass rod and attempted to fold the tent up multiple times.  Each time I was unable to make it small enough to fit into the provided bag.  It appeared to be under immense pressure just with folding it once.  This included folding and the rods inside crossing.  I felt that I needed to attempt something different and safer to secure the tent.  The bottom rod is attached with a small metallic tubular piece with no apparent locking mechanism.  This initially feel off with my first previously mentioned attempt.  I removed this rod completely from the tent in an attempt at putting it up in a safer manner with less stored energy.  After removing this piece I was able to fold the tent with the other rods in it twice.  This made it small enough to fit into the provided storage bag.  I placed it in the bag and left it open.  At this point I began to roll up the piece that was removed.  I placed the metallic tubular piece to make a solid piece.  This piece was coiled up and I was holding it securely in my left hand.  I was preparing to place it into the bag provided by the manufacturer.  While holding it firmly the coiled piece sprung loose, the metallic tubular piece flew off, and the fiberglass pole struck me in the face with an immense amount of pressure.  I was struck across the top of my top lip, then on my left hand.  The impact almost immediately caused angioedema to my upper lip.  This edema made my top lip almost double in size, causing numbness and pain.  Later on I felt prickling on my left hand which I believe to be minute pieces of fiberglass.  This narrative was written approximately 45 minuets after the incident occurred.  It occurred at approximately 1930 eastern standard time in my den at my home.  I was sitting in a revolving office chair when this happened.  My family including my three year old daughter were sitting on the couch behind me (my back was to them) when this occurred.  I immediately checked them for injuries and luckily they were ok and unharmed.  After this occurred I zipped up the provided bag for tent with the tent in it, then I took the other fiberglass rod outside and placed it on the ground near my building for disposal.  After this trauma occurred I googled the product, immediately viewing product recall information.

The people working at the ER were shocked that these fundraisers are still allowed for children, and said they had seen quite a few cases of this. Knowing that we aren't even supposed to use baby powder on our children for fear of inhalation, I was suspicious of the safety and brought the concern to administration at my child's school. They read to me a blurb from the manufacturer and stated that the cornstarch and food dye mixture was FDA approved. I said that means for eating, and they corrected me saying it was safe for inhaling. I have confirmed with a pharmacist at the FDA that their approval is for eating these ingredients, not for throwing and (inevitably) inhaling.

Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested. In a 2015 CPSC safety standard for high-powered magnets CPSC determined the standard should not apply to magnets with a flux index of less than 50.

While we understand the consumer’s concern about a potential strangulation hazard, we are relieved to know that there is no injury involved in this incident as the safety of our consumers and their children is our utmost priority.  Please note we have not received any similar complaints or concerns regarding this product.Independent laboratory testing confirmed that this product and packaging conformed to applicable standards, including ASTM F963-17, and are marked clearly with suitable warnings, instructions and an age grade of 3+.  With respect to the consumer’s concern regarding a potential strangulation hazard, testing confirmed that no such hazard exists and therefore the product does not require a choking hazard warning.  In addition, the toy tool belt was intentionally designed to have a breakaway feature (secured by Velcro) such that it easily releases from the child when pulled.  We investigate all inquiries and incidents, and if appropriate, we incorporate any needed changes to the product or instructions for future production. Since individual circumstances are unique and safety is our top priority, we normally contact the consumer to collect further details and request them to send back the product in question to help us to better understand the issue and address any concerns.  This information is always helpful to us as we committed to continuous consumer feedback and product improvement as part of making high quality products.  After our Consumer Relations department responded to the consumer’s initial email to us in September 2017, it appears the consumer may not have replied back to us so we were unable to resolve the issue for them at that time.

He had some coughing and sore throat and then some vomiting, and the magnets remained.He then told his mom and she took him straight to [REDACTED] where the xray confirmed the 11 total magnets; 2 in the epiglottis area right in the voice box at the entrance of the trachea and 9 in the stomach, stuck together.I was on call for Gastroenterology and for Endoscopy and was called by the Urgent Care physician.I arranged ambulance transport and had an OR team come in including our Gi lab endoscopy nurse.The Radiology report from the Nose-to-Rectum series of films was as follows:  Foreign body: Round metallic spheres are present consistent with ingested magnets. Two of them are in the pharynx. They appear to the right of midline on the frontal radiograph suggesting that they may be lodged in the right piriform sinus. Nine magnets are present projecting over the distal stomach. In each case both clusters of magnets have a linear arrangement and touch each other. However it is not possible to determine if they are intervening anatomic structures, such as an aryepiglottic foldor the bowel wall. Therefore surgical ENT and surgical consultation is warranted. The lungs are clear. The heart size is normal. The bowel gas pattern is normal. No airway abnormality. No bony abnormality. IMPRESSION:   Two magnets in the pharynx, likely in the piriform sinus, and nine linearly arranged contacting magnets projecting over the distal stomach.

A few of us used it today. It made two of us sick (headaches, rapid heartbeat, general feelings of sickness). These people were both within the recommended age range and do not have pacemakers etc. Note that for some individuals, this toy might be extremely dangerous, even lethal. It emits an electric shock on a person's hand which feels pretty similar to accidentally putting one's finger in an electrical socket. It contains some warnings in fine print that: it is not for use for people with epilepsy, a heart condition, or similar related illnesses. It also says, in some of the fine print sections, but not all, that it should not be used by someone pregnant and to keep out of the risk of children. We had no idea what we were buying. We thought it had a shock similar to the old board game Operation, certainly not something painful or potentially dangerous. Clearly people do not always read fine print, especially not on a toy, which people expect to be safe. Not just that, the fine print isn't even the same in each spot so someone who actually does read the fine print might miss a crucial warning that applies to them. And if the wrong person uses this item, I believe they could die or be seriously injured.Please investigate and remove this game from the US market asap.

The father reportedly purchased Buckyball brand magnets 'well over' 5 years ago, before they had children. We (physicians) clarified this point with the family; the father was certain it was Buckyball brand product, as opposed to another high-powered magnet brand, and bought them shortly after the product became available in the U.S. The family still has the magnets but does not have any packaging or storage containers. They do not believe they still have receipts or proof of purchase but will double check. The parents were aware of the dangers of these products and stored them on top of the refrigerator. From time to time, Mom stated that she will find some magnets 'in the couch or around the house' and that 'they are very easy to misplace.' She presumes this is how her 5-year old found the magnets, as the bulk of the product remained out of reach on top of the refrigerator. In addition, Mom notes that her child (5 years old) has played with the product before (while supervised) without incident, though the child was not playing with the product when the ingestion occurred.On June 5th, 2020, the patient came to his mother and told her that he swallowed 3 high-powered magnets and that his throat hurt. Mom called the Poison Center which, in turn, referred the patient to our ED.In our ED, his vitals were stable and normal. He had no difficulty swallowing, no difficulty handling his secretions, no respiratory distress, no drooling, no vomiting and no chest or abdominal pain. He was otherwise at baseline in terms of his health with no recent illness, fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes. His physical exam was completely normal. Abdominal XR imaging was done which showed 3 rounded, radiopaque densities abutting one another, corresponding to the ingested magnetic bucky balls favored to be in the stomach but positioned in close proximity to the transverse colon. Decision was made for patient to have urgent endoscopic retrieval. He was also evaluated by pediatric surgery who agreed with plan. On endoscopy, 3 round 5mm neodymium magnets were found in the distal duodenum/early jejunum and were retrieved with a basket. There was some technical challenge and difficulty with the procedure given how much the magnets had migrated but ultimately the magnets were able to retrieved successfully. The patient recovered well after the procedure and was admitted for further care and observation. The following morning he was well appearing and stable. He was able to eat breakfast without issues. He was discharged home that day, June 6th, 2020.","Bronx","New York",10463,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Hospital Admission","Male","Unspecified","5",No,No,,,No,No,No,,"",

She was swimming at the bottom of the pool and shot up for a breath of air, not paying attention to what was above her (as kids do), and literally got stuck by the top of her head in the velcro to the Bullseye Dart Toss game by Play Day that is sold at Walmart for $14.97. The toy was blown over during normal pool play, and the large velcro part was face down. Furthermore, the part that was facing up is a bowl shape and had filled with water, making it very heavy. She is an extremely strong swimmer and was able to get to the steps with minimal air and scream out for me. There was even a lifeguard at the party who thought she was just playing around with the float until she heard her cries. Her entire head of hair was tangled up in the velcro terribly. She does have curly hair, so I'm not sure if that was a factor, but it took 5 adults to pull her and the float out of the water, drain it, and then an excruciating 20 minutes of pulling her hair out of the velcro while she scream cried. If that had happened to a less strong swimmer, it could have very easily been a terrible tragedy. If my daughter had panicked or didn't have any breath left, it could have been a terrible tragedy. The toy is very unsafe for pool play, especially with the bottom having the ability to hold water, thus making it too heavy to just swim with it on top of you while your head is out of water if you were to get stuck. This could've happened to an adult just as easily. The velcro part encompasses the entire front of the float making it entirely too easy to get stuck like that.","Prosper","Texas",75070,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional","Female","My Child","7",No,No,,,No,Yes,,"I wrote a review on the website and spoke to customer service who said to call and place a complaint because that would get me further.

First, the required childrens product labeling on the product is missing (there is only a flammability tag). Second, the manufacturer (Simulated Wood Grains LLC d/b/a Fort) has declined to share any specific safety testing information despite multiple requests. Third, the magnets in this product were initially supposed to be (1) larger than a quarter, (2) encased in a plastic casing, and (3) sewn into the product with no zipper access. Instead, the product I received has rare earth magnets that are smaller than a quarter (so would NOT pass small parts test tube requirements), that are not encased at all, and are only glued into pouches; on my product, I had at least 2 pouches when opening the product with OPEN FLAPS and exposed magnets. And zippers were added to the product and those zippers are NOT safety zippers and are operational by my 6 year old. The manufacturer (d/b/a Fort) has merely told consumers to re-stick any loose pouches by giving them a high five and that it  should hold and simultaneously suggested to other users of the product to not pick at the magnet pockets as that may lead to loose magnets... except that is exactly what a child would do. In other correspondence, the manufacturer has actually stated that the magnet pouches are glued to enable better access to the magnets in the event of damage/replacement, meaning that this was an intentional design to access magnets on a childrens' product.

SAP toys were marketed in the early 2010s as 1-2 mm rapidly expanding gel beads, but recalled following a case report that led to a small bowel obstruction in an 8-month-old infant.9 Since the recall, SAP are currently available in 1-2 mm size but only expand to about 7-10x its dehydrated size. SAPs are non-toxic and biodegradable, and no poisoning events have been reported from ingestion nor external exposure.10 This is in stark contrast to another Otolaryngology foreign body emergency, button batteries.

Originally, the covers were supposed to be non-removable, but that was changed and to make them safe, [REDACTED] breakaway zippers were going to be used. NONE of these safety features were used. The magnets are smaller than a quarter, they are not in pouches, and they are not sewn in. The magnets are placed in the cover via a slit made in the back and then a small circle cover is glued on over. The glue is not strong and the circle covers come off leaving exposed magnets. The zippers are not [REDACTED] and are not breakaway. This allows for kids to open covers and get to said exposed magnets. The seams are not very strong and ripping open with normal play and some are arriving already busted. This allows easier access to the magnets. Some FORTs have arrived with broken magnets which are sharp and a huge hazard if swallowed. A child had their finger pinched between two magnets when they found them on the outside of the cover while the parent checked and assembled the rest of the covers. Another concern is [REDACTED not having the proper CPSC tracking tags on the FORTs. He markets them as a kids toy, but the FORTs only come with a flammable furniture tag and nothing else regarding toys.Overall, the magnets are not safe and are a huge choking hazard and can cause severe GI damage if multiples are swallowed.

This evening, my husband and I discovered that the magnetic ball point was missing from our child's magnetic stylus pen. As we had never disassembled the pen before, we were uncertain about the method used to secure its components. Upon opening the casing, it became evident that there was no permanent solution in place to firmly hold the magnet. Just before contemplating a visit to the emergency room to ensure that the missing piece had not been swallowed, I fortunately located the magnet. To my surprise, the magnet lacked any discernible fatter end or edge that could effectively secure it within the pen casing. Instead, it was simply a miniature, [REDACTED]-sized magnet loosely positioned within the stylus pen. This unrestricted movement poses a grave risk and is highly dangerous. In light of this alarming discovery, I strongly recommend that Brooklyn Lollipops initiate an immediate product recall and undertake a comprehensive redesign of the magnetic pen stylus. The current design flaw not only endangers the welfare of children but also raises the potential for severe harm or even fatal consequences. It is fortunate that no child has suffered a tragic incident related to this product thus far. I implore the CPSC to thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure the safety of consumers, particularly children, who may come into contact with the Brooklyn Lollipops' Rainbow Magnetic Sketcher. It is crucial that strict measures are implemented to rectify the hazardous design of the magnetic stylus, thereby mitigating the potential for serious accidents or injuries. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I trust that the CPSC will prioritize the well-being of consumers by promptly addressing this safety concern.","Portage","Wisconsin",53901,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Incident, No Injury","Male","My Child","1",Yes,No,,,,Yes,,,"",

",,,,,,,"Amazon.com",,,No,"My daughter was poisoned by water beads in 2017. She now lives with a brain injury called toxic brain encephalopathy. Below is a call to action… What Physicians Need to Know about Water BeadsPlay is the occupation of childhood, toys are the tools and materials of the trade. [REDACTED]. To better prevent, identify, and protect children from potential risks posed by toy products, physicians and researchers must view children as a unique class of workman. Despite the fact that children are not merely miniature adults, and have certain distinct vulnerabilities, the value of occupational medicine perspectives, literature, and expertise can not be overemphasized when assessing potential toy related hazards, and analyzing cases of real world harm associated with play, the pediatric occupation. What physicians need to know about water beads is an illustrative example of this significance. Originally used for industrial purposes, recently water beads have been heavily marketed as a “non-toxic” sensory toy for children and as ammunition for a new type of toy gun.  Water beads are sold under a variety of brand names. The beads are often imported and sold as both an agricultural soil conditioner and as a toy for children without the chemical ingredients and composition listed on the product’s label. Water beads/ Super absorbent polymer balls are designed to absorb water, expand in size and volume, and are most often made of polyacrylamide-polyacrylate ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide is considered non-toxic; however, it is made from the polymerization of neurotoxic acrylamide. [REDACTED][REDACTED]. According to the [REDACTED], polymerized acrylamide gels should be treated with the same caution as acrylamide monomers themselves to avoid repeated accidental exposure to neurotoxic acrylamide monomers ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide solid gels, such as water beads, can contain residual and extremely toxic acrylamide monomers in concentrations of 10-30% ([REDACTED]). Although water bead toys meet current CPSIA standards for heavy metal and phthalate levels, each batch and bag of beads is not required to be pre-tested for monomer concentration levels before being placed in commerce. Acrylamide monomers are easily absorbed into an organism's circulatory system from dermal exposure, inhalation, and ingestion ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide for agricultural purposes is legally permitted to contain a residual level of acrylamide thousands of times greater in concentration than polyacrylamide used in cosmetic formulations and water treatment for drinking water; 500 ppm for agricultural purposes, 0.1 to 0.5ppm for cosmetics, and the residual acrylamide limit for water suppliers by the EPA is less than 0.5 ppb ([REDACTED]). Manufacturers are not required to disclose the initial concentration of acrylamide monomer used to create their polyacrylamide or the amount of residual acrylamide monomer remaining after polymerization in any polyacrylamide-copolymer contained in toy products. When ingestion of water beads is suspected, a high degree of suspicion is necessary. The beads do not behave as traditional foreign bodies due to their size and chemical composition. The chemical composition of the beads is generally unknown to physicians at the point of care and consumers at the point of purchase. Consumption and aspiration of water beads pose a public health risk, and the public should be informed of the dangers ([REDACTED]). Although acrylamide loses some toxicity after polymerization, it can still cause chemical corrosion of the nasal mucosa and can enter the digestive and respiratory tracts, where it is absorbed, entering the systemic circulation and causing toxic reactions ([REDACTED]). [REDACTED]. Additionally, the reduction in gastric protective factors caused by acrylamide exposure also contributes to the dose-dependent degeneration of gastric mucosal integrity, putting the patient's mucosa at risk for erosions and lesions ([REDACTED]).Water beads are banned in Italy and Malaysia because they are a safety hazard. Water beads should not be marketed to children and their families as toys, sensory toys, or therapeutic aids. Because non-toxic is not a regulated term, “non-toxic” claims on a product's label or online listing should not be solely relied upon to eliminate poisoning or chemical exposure from the initial diagnostic assessment or the formation of differential diagnoses. Information and researchIngestion of water beads requires prompt medical attention and evaluation. Diagnosis is made more complicated due to imaging difficulties. ([REDACTED]) Prompt endoscopic removal should be attempted for all patients with no signs of obstruction whenever the gel beads might be in the upper GI tract ([REDACTED]).Case management should not conform to standard protocols of foreign body removal, and early removal whenever possible should be attempted to prevent complications such as obstruction, lung injuries, nasal cavity injuries, hearing loss, seizures, brain injury such as cytotoxic edema, encephalopathy, and exposure to toxic chemicals specifically, extremely neurotoxic acrylamide ([REDACTED]). A high degree of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis due to imaging difficulties, beads may mimic duplicated cysts versus presenting as a traditional foreign body ([REDACTED]).Duplicate cysts are congenital GI tract alignment abnormalities. Duplicate cyst structure can be divided into cystic or tubular on the basis of their structure. Research indicates identification of duplicated cysts is best assessed using ultrasound ([REDACTED]).Due to the ability of water bead material to mimic duplicated cysts, imaging utilized to identify duplicate cyst lesion pathology, ultrasound, should be utilized during assessment for potential water bead ingestions. Medical professionals should be aware ultrasound may underestimate the number of water beads when compared to endoscopic evaluation ([REDACTED]).Water beads can collect, forming a bezoar, asymptomatically in the GI tract without belly distention or traditional GI symptoms of distress. ([REDACTED]). Surgical management with complete removal of hydrogel granules from the gastrointestinal tract is required, when the child presents to hospital with intestinal obstruction symptoms and surgeons must be aware the beads have the ability to collect lower in the GI tract and form a new mass if all beads are not removed. Surgeons should also be aware ultrasound can miss beads lower in the digestive tract ([REDACTED]).Pediatric patients who are young or non-verbal cannot be relied upon to effectively and consistently communicate pain. Furthermore, [REDACTED]Symptoms of pain or distress may be less obvious to those outside the immediate household and include increased night wakings, increased fussiness and irritability.Cases presenting with a dermatitis rash on the mouth and/or hands should be handled very carefully. The presence of a dermatitis rash should alert clinicians to the possibility the patient has suffered a higher level acrylamide dose exposure. Patients, especially ones with the rash should be monitored for follow up care and closely monitored for any signs of regression or neurological involvement. Referral to the developmental pediatrician, neurology, and ECI may be needed. A patient’s clinical history is often the cornerstone of diagnosis in neurotoxicology. Tests to identify exposure to acrylamide are not readily and widely available to clinicians: laboratory studies are unhelpful, evidence of peripheral neuropathy on nerve conduction studies supports the diagnosis of acrylamide neurotoxicity, normal studies do not exclude the diagnosis. [REDACTED]Toxicity symptoms in pediatric patients particularly, when the water bead ingestion timeframe is unknown, include: Dermatitis rash RhinorrhoeaSeizures GI symptoms such as constipation and/or diarrhea; Projectile vomiting and other traditional obvious obstruction symptoms appear after the rash and can be delayed for long periods after initial ingestion due to beads not consistently traveling through the digestive tractPediatric patients can be clingy to caregivers Increased need to nurseWeight loss with normal appetiteSigns and symptoms of motor and sensory peripheral neuropathyCytotoxic edema / cellular edema, seeming to mimic an acute ischemic stroke (EEG may be abnormal when beads are in patient according to one case study [not enough evidence to definitively say if all cases will present this way], CT scan and MRI are normal; according to radiopaedia, MRI with diffuse weighted imaging is able to identify cytotoxic edema) ([REDACTED])Toxic Brain Encephalopathy “Non-toxic” has a specific connotation; for most people it means safe, pure, and not hazardous. [REDACTED] defines the term “non-toxic” straightforwardly as, not toxic. Many consumers are under the impression that when a product is labeled non-toxic it means the product is safe, that it has been thoroughly tested, and is free of toxic chemicals. The act empowering America’s Consumer product regulatory agency is called the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. As of 2011, the term “non-toxic” does not appear in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), rendering the term unregulated due to a lack of a definitive legal definition. The assumption that products are safe, when they bear the label of “non-toxic”, is based on a clever marketing illusion rather than fact. [REDACTED]. Often physicians do not know the chemical composition of toys at the point of care and with approximately 88% of toy products manufactured in China and complex supply chains there is no guarantee of reliable chemical composition information. Water bead injuries, insertions and  swallowings should be reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Poison Control Centers.

We immediately called our pediatrician and brought her in. We left with oral [REDACTED] (anti-vomiting med) and the diagnosis that she was still recovering from the flu she was positive for 8 days priorJanuary 3rd, the vomiting continued. She wasn't keeping any food or milk down, and had 1 wet diaper in 12+ hours. We decided to take her to the emergency room.  In the ER they performed an abdominal X-ray and ultrasound, they also swabbed her nose (because that's what we do now for everyone who walks through the door with an illness) she ended up being positive for COVID, flu and rhinovirus. The X-ray was negative, but the ultrasound was very concerning, and showed some questionable cysts on her ovaries and lower abdominal quadrant, because of that we were transferred by ambulance to a children's hospital who could provide further testing. When arriving at the children's hospital they re-did all of their own testing. The first ultrasound showed a cystic structure in her right lower quadrant.. that warranted further testing.. on top of that, she was continuing to vomit profusely, unable to keep anything down. January 4th they did an oral contrast abdominal X-ray. This X-ray showed a questionable small bowel obstruction, as the contrast stopped and did not make its way into the large bowel. After this she received another abdominal ultrasound which confirmed two cystic lesions measuring 3cm and 2cm. After that, the decision was made to emergently take [REDACTED] to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and check for ovarian contortion. The results after the OR... all clear... no bowel obstruction seen, no cysts seen AT ALL. Just an ileus... a non mechanical obstruction. I asked if they were going to place a nasal gastric tube, and they said not at this time..At first this was a relief. The doctors decided this was all related to gastroenteritis and her body just needed time to clear the viruses.. So we continued trying to feed her and get her to drink.. she continued to profusely vomit. Except her vomit was turning vile. It smelled foul, and had a stool-like appearance. We reported this to the doctors and they brushed it off. This continued for 2 days. January 6th she was getting sicker. She slept 95% of her day, only awake when the medical providers were in the room. She was vomiting so profusely she began to drop her oxygen levels. She was requiring a nasal cannula and they started her on antibiotics for possible aspiration and did a chest X-ray. We spoke to the doctors about our concerns. Things weren't adding up. We explained how her vomit smelled so horrid, it didn't look like normal stomach bile and it certainly didn't smell like it. We were told it's unlikely she's vomiting stool even though we saved all the towels and blankets with the vomit covering them. They ordered a abdominal X-ray which showed distended bowels with no obstructions visible. They said that since she got the surgical exploratory laparotomy and there was no obstruction seen at all, they were SURE her bowels just need some rest. Finally, on January 7th they placed the nasal gastric tube for decompression and bowel rest. Since she was continuing to get worse, she got another abdominal X-ray which showed dilated bowel and air.. they ordered an abdominal ultrasound that once again showed two lower abdominal cysts.. no further intervention was ordered..The next next day, January 8th, she seemed improved. Her personality was coming back, much more energy so we were able to clamp her nasal gastric tube and give her 1 ounce of breastmilk every three hours. We did two feedings like that and then tried to increase it to 2 ounces, but she returned to profuse vomiting. It continued to be foul smelling, thick stool-like appearance, it wasn't even breastmilk coming back up.We told the doctors something else is going on.. we started introducing this crazy idea we had....... the possibility that she ingested water beads, also known as [REDACTED]. We had water beads in the house for our older kids to play with. They were only ever played with during her naps and while they were under 100% supervision. About a month ago some social media posts were coming out about the dangers of these beads causing intestinal blockages, and because of that we threw them out.. or so we thought. When we brought up this idea, it was shot down, if a bead was in there obstructing we would see something on X-ray, air pockets, the blockage we'd see something and we were immediately shot down that this wasn't a possibility. The imaging wasn't showing any blockage. she continued to throw up. She continued to be unable to tolerate any food or drink. They were starting to consider putting an invasive IV in her, called a central line to start giving her nutrition that way. Once again, they ordered another abdominal X-ray... showing no obstruction. she had no not eaten/drank anything in almost a week..This continued on. They continued getting X-rays that showed nothing. They continued getting ultrasounds that showed cysts. Monday night, January 9th, we did our own research. We found medical journals, articles, social media posts. Anything we could find where we found all these other cases, all with similar symptoms as hers. None of the beads could ever be seen on X-ray, and they were all showing up as CYSTS on the ultrasounds. January 10th, Tuesday morning, we weren't taking no as an answer. We told every doctor that walked in the door about our water bead theory and we demanded that we do something else. Anything. Because things weren't adding up. She was continuing to vomit, and continue to have mysterious cysts on every single ultrasound that the doctors were insist weren't there since they weren't seen on her exploratory laparotomy. Finally, that afternoon we did a barium (contrast) enema with abdominal X-ray. One of the water beads had finally made its way far enough down into the colon that we could FINALLY see the blockage. The doctors finally believed us. And then by some miracle because that bead was so far down and with the help of the enema, she was able to pass it on her own! The proof was in the diaper. There was no more guessing. This is what we were dealing with. The problem was there was still one more. Much higher up.. The pediatric surgical team wanted to see if the bead would pass on its own. They felt at this point she had stabilized and if we could avoid surgery that would be the best option.  Her abdominal distention continued, and those two days of waiting, she was in a lot of pain and discomfort. It was awful. Two days passed and she did not pass the bead. On January 12th she went in for abdominal surgery.  The water bead was surgical removed from her small bowel, measuring just slightly smaller than a golf ball, and this time she was thoroughly checked for any remaining beads. Thankfully there were not. 5 ultrasounds, 6 abdominal X-rays, and 2 surgeries later they are finally all out. These water beads/[REDACTED] are so dangerous. They are invisible on an X-ray, and they show up as cysts on ultrasounds,Making it impossible for doctors to determine they are there. They are microscopic out of liquid and so easy for children to even accidentally swallow, and then they continue to expand greater than 1 inch once in liquid. This product being advertised as a sensory toy for kids is harmful. We didn't have these beads for her, she wasn't even allowed to play with them, but she still somehow found some, and ingested them. We had also begun the process of deep cleaning our home & have since found 12 beads.. that were invisible to the eye but after soaking toys in a bathtub overnight they were then discovered.","Biglerville ","Pennsylvania",17307,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Hospital Admission","Female","My Child","1",No,No,,,,No,,,"",20230112-A8137-2147351450

I received a Fort in October 2021 but received a product that had a visible zipper, magnets that were not sewn in but secured with a removable patch, and weak magnets that were incorrectly placed when manufactured. In order for the toy (he defines it as furniture) to even function as created he suggested all those who received the weak, defective axial magnets (instead of diametrical ones that most of the Forts manufactured had)  to remove half of the adhesive magnet patches and flip the magnets so the number of N and S polarities were equal. That is not only 2 painful hours of my life I will never get back, but this toy is now a huge safety hazard because the magnets (that are about the size of a nickel) are easily reachable by my 2 young kids.

Were there any injuries that happened or may have happened while using the product?- Yes. An injury that resulted in an emergency room visit and stitches. How did any injuries occur?- The kitchen set is designed in a way that the plastic handles are affixed to the panels with what very closely resembled sheet metal screws. The screws hold the handles by being threaded from the back of the panel through the panel into a molded part of the handle that is very thin and not tapped to receive a screw, it is just small enough that it is a tight fit against the sharp sheet metal screw. The handle on the lower part of the fridge area on the kitchen set was somehow ripped off by the child during playtime which exposed one of the  the sheet metal screws pointing through. The other screw fell out of the hole but the one that caused the injury got stuck in the particle board when the handle failed. The child later in the day slipped on her blanket on the ground in front of her kitchen set when getting off her bed, she fell into the front of the kitchen set where she was scratched and stabbed by the exposed screw. She was immediately taken to the hospital after examining the wound and received stitches in response to the wound and we were informed that there will likely be a lifelong scar as a result.","Saint Ann","Missouri",63074,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Emergency Department Treatment Received","Female","My Child","3",,,,,,,,,"",

Both products presented significant safety concerns:[REDACTED]Playground Set: A few weeks later, I received this product and found it was not properly sanded and also lacked any protective coating. While attempting to assemble it, I received several splinters, causing me to abandon the assembly.These products were intended for use by my 1-year-old son. However, upon inspection and attempted assembly, I determined they were unsafe for use. The lack of proper finishing and the presence of splinters violate safety standards, specifically the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) of 2008 and ASTM F2613: Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Children's Chairs and Stools, which require that wood must be smooth, free from splinters, and all surfaces properly sanded.The products were not used as intended due to the safety concerns. While I sustained minor injuries (splinters) during assembly, fortunately, my child did not use the products and was not injured. However, had these products been used as intended, there was a significant risk of splinters or other injuries to a young child.These safety violations in children's furniture products prompted me to report this issue to ensure the safety of other children and to bring attention to potentially widespread manufacturing defects in these items sold on Amazon.","Harrison ","New Jersey",07029,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional","Male","Self","33",Yes,No,,,,No,,,"",

I immediately went to inspect all the pieces in the container and found a loose magnet along with the majority of the 58 pieces with cracks, some of them significant. If she had swallowed loose magnets her life would have been in danger. My 1yr old isn't allowed to play with these and my 4yr old plays with them appropriately. There is no biting or stepping on them or throwing and they get cleaned up and put away each time. (We even have carpet and don't even wear shoes in the house.)

In one photo the 1. pile had significant damage, 2. pile had medium cracks or separation beginning to form at the seams and 3. pile with minimal or no cracking. It's only a matter of time before all the Quibix pieces begin to break further. It's also clear that these two sets purchased from different locations, at different times are defective.I avoided buying knock of brands of other magnet products because of the risk of breaking with magnets falling out and putting my children at risk.

After multiple trips to the pediatrician regarding the ear infection, she suddenly began having seizures. She was admitted in [REDACTED] Childrens Hospital. She had CT and MRI. The MRI found a shadow in her ear canal that was believed to be a cyst. During exploratory surgery the ENT extracted a water bead. It had expanded inside her ear, completely destroyed her ear drum, and entered into her inner ear. There it had festered for weeks resulting in the untreatable ear infection and triggering the onset of seizures. She spent 27 days in the hospital. 18 of those days were in the ICU on [REDACTED] and Ketamine drip. She had a complete plasma exchange to essentially replace her immune system. It has been nearly 13 months and she continues to have as many as 10 seizures per day. There is no  family history of seizures, no genetic predisposition, no brain structural anomalies.

(It should be noted that the company had the Product tested by an independent testing laboratory, most recently in July of 2024; all tests were passed.) In November the company initially learned that a person was claiming in an Incident Report that the Product started to smoke, and presented a possible fire hazard. The company discussed that incident with that person, and continued investigating the Product. In what appears to be an isolated issue, it is believed that overheating was likely caused in one manufacturing “lot” by a malfunction in the LED light strip along the side edge of the Product. Due to the anonymous nature of the present Incident Report, the company has been unable to investigate this particular incident.Without any admission of liability or wrongdoing, the company has voluntarily discontinued future sales of the Product having the LED light strip. Moreover, it has re-engineered the product to use a different light source to replace the LED light strip.",

Spin Master did not receive back this unit.This product element is a ‘foldable’ circular fabric covered play-space with a metal perimeter band inside enabling ‘twist-fold’ similar to a bandsaw blade fold-up storage. This feature enables the product to be shipped and stored in a much smaller footprint than the original play-space.  Accompanying files include images of the product.Spin Master has produced approximately 250,000 of this Bakugan Toy #64439 since June 2021, this is a single call or notification for a potential defect. This, as all Spin Master toy products, have gone through rigorous global safety and performance testing protocols exceeding ASTM mechanical requirements without exception. The twist-fold feature is environmentally tested – humidity, salt spray, temperature cycling - as well as dynamically tested through 500 minimum cycles protocol for release to the USA market. The case involved here is an isolated one possibly caused by unique series of circumstances (a) factory moisture (b) inconsistent closure crimp (c) long term retailer storage (c) ‘perfect’ user loading, or series of loading, on compromised crimp joint creating dynamic failure (d) user in the least opportune position.  Mentioned above, this is a single, isolated report of this kind for this product. Resulting from this report, Spin Master has (1) sampled inventory and (2) thoroughly reviewed/redirected the manufacturing environment of this product with high emphasis on handling and storage of raw materials as well as finished goods through this value chain. We have additionally increased the frequency of finished goods destructive testing in assurance neither rusted perimeter band nor compromised crimp-joint can be released to the market. Spin Master Consumer Care team has subsequently contacted [REDACTED], assured his son is uninjured, and directly resolved the case with a full product replacement.
