This was actually the third time that this happened with this toy, which is why I felt prompted to write you today.  The first time, I chalked it up to an uncoordinated child who was riding the toy, the second time I thought it was just a coincidence.  The third time, I decided to write, as this is just a terrible toy. This is a poorly designed toy in which the balance is off.  The front of the toy tips forward very easily, with the slightest movement when it is in the ride-on position.  (The toy is marketed as having three positions for play). It is obvious to me now that it is very easy for a child to pitch forward and smash their face on the ground, in addition to being unassisted by their hands to break the fall, since they are holding onto the handles of it.  As an adult handling the toy and manipulating it in this manner, it becomes apparent that it is a design flaw, as it happens so easily with minimal effort. In two previous separate incidents (not reported prior to this), two visiting children had pretty bad forward-tipping accidents on this toy.  In one of those incidents, the child tipped forward while riding on the toy and hit her chin, while her teeth penetrated her bottom lip, sustaining a rather nasty bloody laceration from the impact.  We were grateful that it happened in the house on the wood floor and not outside on the concrete or asphalt. (Yikes!) The incidence that just occurred this week (7/5/11) was a close call with my own child.  She was just sitting there, hardly even moving on the toy, and I was sitting on the ground nearby playing with my older child.  Suddenly, as she stretched her feet out forward on the wheels of the toy, the toy pitched forward and I caught my daughter by her face just in time before she and the toy hit the ground.  The toy is now out of reach, as we have determined it to be an unsafe toy that causes injury.",,,92084,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Level of care not known","Female","My Child","1",Yes,No,,,No,No,No,," Radio Flyer takes product safety issues very seriously.

Yesterday, we witnessed that our daughter flipped over forward, while riding on our singing pink little riding pony [Rock n' Roll Pals (048181?), without wheels], manufactured by Kiddleland Toys Ltd.  When she flipped over the pony, she hit her head on the corner of a table that was three feet away, causing us to worry if there might be any permanent damage.  We have currently removed the toys.  The toy indicates that it is age-appropriate for 12-36 months, which in this case we were not negligent.  They are also very mild mannered little ladies.I presume that the Rockers do not have enough support forward or back ward, because I simply tried dropping the Rocker Pony down straight from under three feet on the carpet, and the result is that the arch of the rocker forces the rocker go forward because of the weight of the head of the pony and causes the flip.  In these incidents, the rider adds additional weight, making the pony top-heavy, thus causing the flip forward with the momentum and the lack of extended support.We recommend that a review and quality control check on this toy be done accordingly.  Furthermore, this toy ought to be recalled due to the design with the lack of support.

First, the test performed by the complaintant, while well intended, is too elementary on its own merits to be valid in any way.  Simple dropping any toy to determine whether it is weight biased and then extrapolating that the childs weight magnifies the problem proves nothing, whereas extensive safety tests performed by Kiddieland in accord with all established requlations over a ten year period is actually meaningful.  Furthermore, no child should be using a rocking toy when sharp objects are in the vicinity, so the question of adult supervision, clearly marked on the package, comes into play.  Finally, the safety record of Kiddieland rockers, when used according to sensible guidelines, is completely untarnished.  Kiddieland hopes to be able to discuss all this with the complaintant in the near future.",

","Toys & Children","Riding Toys","Powered Riding Toys (1330)",1330,"FISHER-PRICE BRANDS",,,"Frc29",,,,"Walmart","Florida",11/24/2018 ,Yes,"We went on a family camping trip and took the Barbie Camping hot wheel with us for my daughter to use. It seemed fitting. I didn't know there was even a recall on it and now i feel so so so horrible as a parent. How was i supposed to know or to think about checking the products against recalls- especially one that i had just bought! So we were at a family camping trip and there's 11 of us there. It's our 4th day (out of 6) and my parents are fishing off the dock while my daughter is riding my nephew in the hot wheel. I was sitting on the cabins screened in porch and i see my daughter getting too close to the dock and remind her that the alligators will eat her. There's really one in there and if course i doubt want her playing near the water when I'm not there to watch her. Well as they keep getting closer to the water my daughter started screaming that it's broke. I see her stand up some and the camper is still riding and she started screaming about not wanting the alligator to eat them. I run outside and before i can reach her the hot wheel hits the water and there's no real shallow part to the lake so I'm screaming and panicking cause i know my nephew can't swim and there really is an alligator in the water- I've saw him before. Add i am still running to them i see my dad drop his fishing pole and jump in the lake right after the kids hit the water. The water goes to his waist which isn't that deep for an adult but it is to a child. Anyhow he grabs my nephew up and throws him toward the grass and me as i run up and then he grabs my daughter and walks out with her and tells me to never buy another da*n hot wheel again! It seemed like an incident that took forever but it felt like i was seeing it in slow motion. It all really happened pretty quickly. I had to console my daughter and she was scared and shaking because id the alligator. So i feel so horrible about using that constantly as a warning reason but how was i to know the camper would malfunction??!! My dad lost his good fishing pole to the lake and of course the camper drowned and was seriously too heavy for me to fish out of the water. I actually didn't see the point as i didn't think it'd be recalled. So now i have a distraught daughter, a mad father, a mother who keeps reminding me that it's my fault and i could've killed the 2 kids,  and a nephew that said he had fun. I just saw that it was recalled and now i feel 100% relieved because i can show my parents that it wasn't me to blame but the toy maker. I can't get back my dad's good/lucky fishing pole, the $398+tax i spent on my daughter's camper that she got for Christmas,  or the time spent consoling my daughter or the time lost while my parents yelled at me- and im an adult btw. Smh. Anyhow i do know that the FRC29 was the sane exact number on my daughter's camper because i originally wrote all the numbers down in case it was stolen from our home- then id have the serial numbers to prove it was mine if they found it or located It at a thrift store or whatever. So i know it's the right number. I don't know the color of the petal tho, but i can assume with the numbers being the same and the incident at hand- that it was the same gray one. My daughter now wakes up screaming from nightmares about drowning and alligators. I am taking her to a therapist who says she PTSD from the traumatic incident. It seems crazy and unreal- but then again, my life feels like a movie-a not well written movie tho. Lol.Thank your and sorry my story was so long. Thank you for giving me the relief that it wasn't my fault- rather it was yours. So what happens next? Btw- very glad for life and no injuries. Also the exact location was at [REDACTED] and they don't have direct address for it.- just the longitude and latitude. But I can tell toy about the location.

It appeared to me that at least three items resulted in her forward ejection from the toy, namely her travel speed, her seating position/high center of gravity on the seat which appeared to be even with or slightly above the hand wheel and the small 2  diameter caster wheels that could not easily roll over a tapered wooden threshold/transition strip between two rooms. In my judgment it was at least these three factors that resulted in a sudden stop to the toy as it hit the tapered threshold and pitched my granddaughter forward, over the hand-wheel and on the floor!I did review you safety precautions for using the YBIKE on line and noted that you specify using the toy on a smooth flat surface along with protective clothing for the child including a safety helmet.  However there was no precaution regarding the situation we encountered when operating the toy between rooms over a tapered threshold strip.I would also recommend that you post a visible label on the toy noting that a safety helmet must be worn when operating the YBIKE!

However, whenever my son sits on it and rides, the back bolt comes out where the base meets the dino.  If we don't continually tighten it, the thing falls apart.  Luckily, he only likes to sit on it, because if he wanted to ride it all the time we'd just have to take it away.  The bolt that holds the front wheel has also fallen out, when his friend was riding it.  She was about 25 lbs at the time.  My son is about 36lbs, but the toy claims it goes to 40lbs.  We've also had a tiny 3.5 year old friend  (about 28lbs) flip over the front handlebars when riding it.

At one year of age we seated him on the rocker, gently moving him back and forth.  He loved  it!  At 14 months he was able to climb on the rocker and rock himself.  Although this rocker is indeed the cutest, I do not consider it safe for the ages it is intended-one to three years.  With his Dad sitting next to the rocker on the floor and both his Grandparents nearby, we urged him to rock. As he rocked a bit more all on his own power, suddenly the rocker flipped over backwards, with my Grandson hitting the floor with his head and the rocker on top of him.  He was screaming.  He did have a bump on his head--thank goodness, the floor was carpeted, he just missed the marble fireplace hearth.  It does not seem that a toy made for a one to three year old should have this issue--especially with a child at the low end of the age requirement.  My son was right there, but, never thought that his son was in danger, he reached out to grab the baby as the rocker flipped, but,  not soon enough to prevent the injury.  Afterwards as we examined the rocked, it seems that the arc is inadequate.  Or, as my husband suggested, that a wooden stop should have been a part of the rocker to keep it from overturning.  I need to add that our baby is under 25 lbs.  We continue to let the baby ride his horse, but, now have a hand at all times on the rump of the toy, to prevent this from ever happening again.  I did send an email to customercare@rockabye.com, several weeks ago without any response.  I am a Grandmother and have never reported a safety concern about a toy, but, as a RN, as well, feel I need to express my concern about the safety of this toy in order to prevent injury to another baby.","Manchester","New Jersey",08759,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional","Male","Other Relative","1",Yes,,,,,,,"Now hold rear of horse whenever baby rides it","ROCKABYE TOYS INC.:  All of our rockers are tested to conform to all safety regulations and all have passed testing before they are sold to consumers.

It is unfortunate that no one actrually witnessed how the arm broke off, however.  This is not something that is easily duplicated and, of course, the item passes all tests without fail.  Nevertheless, Kiddieland is taking immediate action on all furure production to strengthen/reinfoce the arm so nothing short of a baseball bat would be able to fracture it.  The mother who reported this is being sent a replacement toy at no charge immediately and we are enclosing a pre-paid postal box so that she can send the fractured arm back to us for evaluation, and she is also emailing images of the toy.

This was first brought to our attention in April of 2013, BTW, and we are as puzzled now as we were then to ascertain exactly what might have happened.  All of our toys are rigorously tested repeatedly and there have been no other reports of this type brought to our attention.  In point of fact, the safety rail described has a firm locking device when properly snapped into place by an adult, and a child cannot unsecure it, so it seems that the lock may not have been fully engaged at the time.  Beyond that, the distance a child could fall off the ride on is quite short and it is difficult to comprehend how such an injury could have actually taken place unless there were mitigating circumstances or misuse.  In short, Kiddieland is so very sorry that this child was injured, but the circumstances are suspect, at best. ",

That said, the purchase was made in December of 2018 and the incident happened in January of 2019, but the report to CPSC was only made one full year later, which is difficult to understand.  Also curious is the claim it was the battery that had ruptured and I note that Kiddieland does not manufacture same.  Finally, the area where this took place was in Arizona where temperatures often exceed 100 degrees, so it would be nice to know exactly where the toy was stored and for how long.

We have endeavored to speak to the individual that reported the incident and have not yet been able to connect, but will continue trying, of course.  At the heart of the issue is the plain fact that the toy was misused, and more than once, with little or no apparent adult supervision or guidance.  No ride on toy is designed to be ridden backwards the way in which this one was - and more that once with the same unfortunate results each time, per the report.  This is the reason all manufacturers clearly state Adult Supervision Required on their packages, including Kiddieland.  This particular product has been successfully tested over and over again for normal and reasonable use, but that use does not include riding backwards or standing on it or anything of the sort.",

In point of fact, this item (and others like it) are routinely tested according to the most stringent USA and worldwide standards and always passes without exception.

We purchased this in Jan/February of 2025 for roughly $400. My children have since been riding it - last week I noticed my kids were hitting things at full speed and then crying and incredibly scared, clearly an accident. My children do not hit things with their ride on toys and never have up until this point - which we found to be very odd. My husband checked the entire toy over to ensure there was no possible corrosion or mud stuck under the pedal - which there was not. Fast forward to this past Sunday around 11am - we were all out enjoying our backyard and the spring weather. My kids were driving the four wheeler when all of the sudden it goes barreling down the hill and doesn't stop. It hits our trampoline at max speed and the tires continue rolling and the four wheeler does not stop, even after hitting the trampoline. My 4 year old son was driving it and was crushed and his throat and the trampoline medal were touching, keep in mind the four wheeler's tires were still spinning and it was still trying to go. It would NOT STOP! We got our son out of the four wheeler and it was still running, almost like the gas was being pressed, except there was nobody on it or near it. This could have resulted in my son breaking his neck or worse - getting decapitated. This is all due to a gas pedal that is FAULTY. This could have KILLED MY INNOCENT TODDLER. This was supposed to be a safe toddler toy. Instead it could have killed him!As you can see in the attached images, the roll cage bar that is there for PROTECTION couldn't even protect him in an event like this as it broke into literal pieces! The four wheeler kept accelerating and wouldn't stop after it hit the trampoline and continued breaking pieces off it.This toy is going straight to the DUMP! As should all of the other ones located on store shelves. This is absolutely absurd! This should not have happened to a child. It should have been looked over a million times for safety before being sold for consumer purchase. AND, should come with some sort of braking system!To include, the age range specifically states 3-8 years old - this is untrue! This toy should NOT be utilized until AT LEAST 5 or 6 years old due to how fast it goes - although it says it only goes 5 MPH, I highly doubt.","wichita falls","Texas",76306,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Incident, No Injury","Male","My Child","3",Yes,No,,,,Yes,,,"BRC TOYS LLC: We are committed to designing and manufacturing products that are safe and fun to ride.

When I won the item from auction online, I knew it was missing a wheel and a wing on the toy and was going to get it fixed for my son to play with it.  While I was searching for replacement parts, I saw on https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/larose-industries-recalls-peanuts-flying-ace-ride-on-toys that the toy was recalled back in 2015 and I could do nothing with the toy except destroy it.  I brought this to the auction houses attention and they did not want to take the item back, and I am worried they are selling more items that have been recalled.  If the item wasnt in as bad of shape, I would have not thought about it and not known that it was recalled and my son could have been injured (he is 2 yrs of age at this time, so alot of items still go in his mouth.)  He could have also been hurt by the item itself by the wing being broken off or the wheel missing.  I am highly upset.  I was hoping something could be done about the lack of effort on their end, so I started looking to see if it were even legal for them to sell this item to me.  Under USC 15, chapter 47, section 2068, it talks about it being illegal for anyone to offer recalled items to anyone else.  Going on in 2069, the law states that a fine of up to $100,000 could be assessed per item up to $15million, per day (if I read this correctly.)  I know they sold this item to me, I can provide any receipts or pictures as you desire, and can only think of how many more items they sell that fall into this category. This is only one of many locations this business has and Im sure there are many other illegal items being sold. Its very upsetting and I would like something to be done about it.  Please advise if there is anything else that you would like for me to do to assist.

They like to pretend it’s a real horse and feed it, brush it etc. this morning my son (5 years, 42 lbs) sat on it and rocked for a little bit. The front spring broke through the plastic holding it on and the entire horse collapsed to the ground. His arm was bruised from the impact of the front post, and his leg was cut. Upon further clean up/inspection we realized he had a metal shard in his leg. When my husband barely moved the horse to try and figure out what happened the back spring then came disconnected and the whole thing fell down. This could’ve been my 3 year old, it could’ve been one of their eyes, or even knocked their front teeth out. This toy is highly concerning.

After extinguishing the fire, crews noted a large melted puddle of plastic with what appeared to be a battery and electrical wires in the center of the garage floor. There was little else involved in the fire. A security system picture revealed the location had been occupied by a battery operated riding child's toy.

Luckily she was able to get this out of his throat and he was saved.  He was very close to not making it.  It was the scariest moment of our lives.  Basically, the distributor (Moderno Kids) says that it is not their problem because they are not the manufacturer.  However, the manufacturer is in China.

Additionally, they say that the following:[Redacted], all tapes as well as all packing materials and plastic bags should be removed prior to giving any toy to a child. This toy has ASTM F963 certification that confirms its compliance with all toy safety standards. We will definitely address this with manufacturer, but dont forget that all little kids require constant supervision because they are unpredictable in many ways.Here is why this is wrong... This is not about lack of supervision.  My wife was there with him and this is why he is alive.  This is not about following instructions.  We did this. We removed everything that was evident.  This sticker (and there is more than one that is small like this) is transparent with nothing on it at all.  They could easily create a larger sticker, change the color, use large foam instead of the sticker, clearly state all items that need to be removed, etc. However, they choose to cut corners and this is bound to cost a child a life.

There is a heart shape compartment on the front inside of the handlebars at chest height.  This compartment opens from the bottom and lifts upwards.  The battery case is in this area and it can also be used to carry toys.  The lid can get stuck in the up position and it is easy for a toy to become lodged in  the  compartment and the  lid will not close. On Thursday Oct 13th, my daughter and I were alarmed to see that [redacted] was riding around with this lid stuck opened and the sharp pointed end of the heart aimed directly at her chest.  If she were to stop suddenly, such as hitting a curb or other object she could be thrown forward and impaled in the chest by the sharp point.  I feel this could be the cause of a very serious injury and perhaps even death if they were to hit that point at great force.I called Huffy Corporation this morning and talked to them about my concerns. The lady said she could send me a lid to the compartment if I wanted to replace it.  I told her that even with a new lid it could still be kept opened if a big toy was put into it and the danger would still be there.  Her only comment then was I will pass this along to our safety people.  I would have figured that since this item poses a large possibility of injury they would have reacted with more urgency over seeing that I, as a concerned consumer and grandmother was worried enough to report it.

There is a Ford decal on the inside of the pedal car The pedal car is manufactured in China. I thought that some areas of the sheet metal construction were not properly formed resulting in what I considered excessively sharp edges. I did the assembly on the toy per the enclosed instructions, and while checking it over, I noticed that the sheet metal side body panels where they meet the dash area, are not crimped over like the balance of the sheet metal, which results, I feel, in excessively sharp and hazardous edges.  How sharp?  Well, while not the most scientific method in the world, I took a fresh carrot the size of an adult finger, and gently pushed it against the right side poorly crimped area and that edge sliced that carrot like a knife would. Imaging what would happen if a child slipped and their hand or face happened to hit that edge. The pedal car is made in China according to seller.  I have been in discussion with [REDACTED] at the Sellers company, and he has been somewhat helpful with regards to a partial refund on my payment.  However, regardless of any refund, the inherent danger of the sheet metal remains, and I thought you and your office may want to probe this further. II am enclosing pics.

On Saturday he was riding it and drove it through a barb wire fence and cut his neck very bad.  It was 4cm laceration that cut completely though his skin.  I was watching my son, I just couldn't get there in time to stop him from driving between the strands of barb wire.  We own 5 other Fisher Price Power Wheels, and have never had any accidents like this.  We've owned and used Power Wheel products for almost 5 years. The power of the Lil' Buggy, set for children age 2 and up, combined with the low statue of this buggy made for a very dangerous situation.  My child was supervised, but I wasn't able to get to him before he drove into the barb wire fence.   I ran as fast as I could to get him free, it was too late.  He had to be rushed to the ER, with a large  laceration on his neck under his chin and received 7 stitches. Here are the problems I see with this vehicle toy.1. It sits too low to the ground and very aerodynamic. 2.  It has NO windshield or other device to keep a child from driving through a barb wire fence or under a car and pinning themselves and choking to death.  It could easily go under a vehicle and pin a child, choking them or burning them (if the car had recently been on)3. This buggy goes very fast and has a lot of power, going over garden hoses and other obstacles that stop our other Power Wheel products, that results in more probability of lodging the buggy under a car/truck or through a fence such as what happened to my son. 4. My son was pinned against the barb wire fence, he was unable to reach the reverse button between his legs to get himself out of the situation.  If the child was to get pinned under a vehicle they would not be able to push the reverse button to remove themselves from under a vehicle.  5.  My son panicked and continued to push the gas pedal, as I assume most 2 year old's would and the car continued to spin the tires trying to drive forward.  I believe that a cut off switch would be a great idea on all power wheels, so that it could detect when a car/truck/others tires were spinning and it would shut off power to the battery and the car would stop.  This would keep the car from pushing the child under a vehicle or fence. I believe this Lil' Buggy should be recalled and spare other parents from what we just went through.  I will add the 5 other power wheels we own sit higher and have a hood/nose/front end with a windshield that keeps them 1' away from obstacles such as fences, vehicles or other dangers.  We followed all of the rules set forth on the instructions.  I would have never in a million years thought that it would drive the font of it through the barb wire fence as it's never happened with our other 5.  It was very scary for our family and could have been so much worse, my little boy could have died.  If it had cut his airway or jugular vein, we are so thankful and blessed that he is going to make a full recovery, we don't want anyone else to go through this.

This trike has the option of putting handle bars in a mode that they do not turn the front wheel when being pushed. The handle bars were disengaged as I had just finished pushing him around a track several times. I tell this because instructions state a quick sharp turn of front wheel can cause tipping.

While the consumer was not willing to speak with them on the phone and only provided minimal information via email, we understand that the consumer’s son was seated, riding his Stable Buddies ride-on and was not turning at the time of the reported fall. We also understand that nothing on the ride-on was broken. It is not clear if the consumer or anyone else witnessed the fall, and the consumer indicated that his son had previously ridden the ride-on without issue, sometimes while “standing up.” We note that the consumer’s son, at two years of age, is below the recommended age of three for the Stable Buddies. Further, the Owner’s Manual provided with the Stable Buddies indicates that the rider should remain seated while riding and that the rider should avoid sharp turns and steep inclines, among other things. Without more information, it is difficult to say what might have caused the ride-on toy to tip over as reported by the consumer, and Dynacraft’s Customer Service Manager is not aware of any similar reports.

Toddler is 35” tall and weighs 24 pounds.The rocking horse has two yellow handles- one on each side of the horse’s head. Each handle has a button that when pressed controls the motion of the battery operated horse. The right button controls the forward backward motion and the left button controls the music. Each button is connected and soldered to 2 coated wires inside the handles.  They travel from the 6 V battery up through the horse ‘s body to the button in the handle and then back down into the body of the horse to the 6 V battery.  The other button has the same configuration of two  more wires. Because of extra  length of wiring inside the horse, if a button is removed from a handle, the wires can be pulled out longer than 12 inches. Once exposed, these two wires are able to be opened to form a loop up to 10 inches in diameter. The buttons only press into or sit in a cutout space in the plastic handles with no way to permanently connect them, snap them, or screw them in.  The buttons are able to be loosened by hand and then pulled out without the use of tools. If a button was pulled out by a child exposing the two wires connected to it, the child could easily pull the two wires open  and fit his/her head through the loop. If the small child’s head/neck became entrapped in the loop they could hang roughly 12 inches off the ground and present a scenario for strangulation. Upon contacting the manufacturer it was suggested that the product purchased by the consumer might be defective. The representative stated that he would inspect several rocking horses at the facility and try to remove the buttons from the handles. He reported back that it would require a screwdriver to pry them off. The customer then ordered a second identical rocking horse from the same manufacturer and found that the buttons in fact COULD be removed by hand just as easily as with the original rocking horse in this report camplaint. She would ask that this horse be inspected by someone professional with the safety experience, and possibly recalled.","Bloomingdale","Illinois",60108,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Incident, No Injury","Unknown","My Child","1",Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,"Product was not returned- kept by consumer in case of CPSC inspection"," PlePeg Perego offered to send a call tag to bring the toy into the factory for inspection.

Notably, the process of  applying the brake with the handgrip serves to instantly cut power to the motor, and the resulting friction in the motor drive system of this low speed product will bring the product to a prompt stop.  Razor also has implemented a customer satisfaction practice of utilizing a locktite glue on the set screw for the brake disk, and will provide a substitute screw on request.  Tightening the existing screw as a matter of product inspection and maintenance, or replacing with the locktite substitute, appears to eliminate this as a potential issue.  Razor encourages parents to always check and maintain such products to minimize instances of parts loosening with use over time. ",

I purchased Moderno Kids 1x Porsche Boxster 12V Kids Ride on car with battery powered wheels that also came with a remote control for parental control for my grand daughters 1st birthday.  However, one night while everyone was sleep the car came on by itself and the wheels of the car were turning but it did not move, both the car and the remote was downstairs in the family room.  My son in law ran downstairs to try to turn off the car but he could not get the car to cut off either by pressing the on/off switch in the car or with the remote so he had to lift the seat and detach the battery in order for the car to turn off.  At the time of the incident no one was using the ride on car, the on/off switch was off, the remote was off.  Fortunately, no one was injured.  The concern is that if the ride on car is able to come on by itself and can not be turned off with the power switch on the car or the remote control this could definitely be a safety issue/defect especially if the child is sitting in the car.  The second concern is that the battery is stored under the seat where the child is sitting and if the car won't shut off by pushing the on/off button or by the remote this could pose a safety risk to the child.  The third concern is that if no one was home and the car came on and was powered by the battery for a continuous amount of time could have resulted in overheating, fire or explosion.

We take every report of this nature very seriously hence our response below. We regret that the submitter expressed dissatisfaction with the Product. Customer satisfaction is our top priority. The submitter used and was in possession of the Product for more than 30 days before informing us that she wanted to replace it. Because she was in possession of the Product beyond our 30-day return period, as part of our customer service, we did inform the submitter that she could receive replacement parts of the Product in accordance with the terms of our warranty or allow us to inspect the Product to verify her concerns. Unfortunately, she did not exercise any of the available options. Without being afforded the opportunity to inspect the Product, we have no way of determining the substantive veracity of her claims.For the record, we have been selling the Product for about 2 years now. It is one of our best-selling products in the market. It has at least a 95% Amazon positive feedback rating, and great reviews from most of our customers thereon and on other online outlets. We sell thousands of the Product every month and have never received any complaints at all, not least of the nature alleged by the submitter. Before being released to the market, the Product underwent a battery of exhaustive testing. It meets the rigorous ASTM standards. It is ASTM approved, a prerequisite to being sold in the USA. It also meets the strict European standards on safety of toys. We have therefore met all the required safety standards and have been issued all the obligatory safety certificates as proof of this.Without questioning the motive of the submitter, the Product simply does not have the capacity nor the capability of automatically switching on of its own accord as alleged by the submitter. This is simply not possible. For it to turn on, it requires deliberate, discerning and cognizant physical action by a person.It is also important to note that the submitter appears to have purchased the Product for a 1 year old child against the clear warning and safety labels attached to the Product and specified in the product description online, as per regulatory requirements. It is rated for 2-plus year old children when used in remote model by parents. Children aged 3 years and over, can use it by themselves. In conclusion, and as earlier stated, we take every report seriously. Out of abundance of caution, we are in the process of reviewing our existing inventory of the Product to ensure and maintain the highest of safety standards.Sincerely,Serge KopilAuthorized RepresentativeModerno LLC",

The age requirements are 1.5 - 5 years and the weight limit is 50 lb.  My child is 2 years old and weighs 28 lbs (well within the age and weight limits).The incident occurred within two days of using the product.  The truck seems to have a tendency to be unstable on hard surfaces (despite the product description pictures showing the truck being used on hard surfaces).  It is more stable on carpeted areas.On 10/17/2016 my child was sitting in the truck in our kitchen.  My mother and I were both standing right there within arm's reach of him, watching him play with the truck.  He was using it appropriately.  The door was facing away from us and he attempted to exit the truck.  He was holding onto the door of the truck for support and was re-positioning his legs to get them out of the hole in the bottom of the truck, over the seat, and onto the floor so he could exit.  However, as he was attempting to do so, the entire thing tipped over sideways and fell on top of him.  Because of the angle (the truck tipped over away from where my mother and I were standing), we were unable to grab onto the truck to keep it from tipping over.  After the whole thing fell over with my son inside, we both lifted the truck off of my son.  He had fallen out face-first onto the floor when the truck tipped over.  He was screaming and crying and bleeding from the mouth.  Both of his upper front teeth were broken.  One tooth was half gone and the other one was fractured.  Both were loose and his gums were bleeding.My child then required an emergency dental appointment where x-rays were taken to assess the damage.  He needed a seal applied on both teeth to temporarily build the broken one back up a little and coat the fractured one to protect it from breaking apart.  He also required a chest x-ray to ensure that no parts of the broken-off tooth had been aspirated (thankfully the results determined this was not the case).  After a follow-up dental appointment two weeks later, it was determined there isn't anything else that can be done to permanently fix his teeth other than to restrict him from biting into any hard/crunchy foods until he is old enough to understand that he cannot use his front teeth to bite into anything until he loses them in 4-5 years and his permanent teeth come in to replace them.  Functionally and cosmetically my child's teeth are not the same due to this incident.  It was a very traumatic experience for my child that he is still talking about and processing a month later.It's really too bad because this seemed like a cute product and my child really enjoyed playing with it prior to this incident.  However, there is a serious safety issue with the product.  This should not have happened.  There are no warnings or cautions noted anywhere on the product or packaging stating that it could tip over (although even if there had been, we would not have allowed it to be purchased for him in the first place as this is a huge safety concern for obvious reasons).  My child was using the product appropriately and under close adult supervision when the incident happened.  It is clearly an unsafe product and needs some serious renovations to better distribute the child's weight, especially as they are exiting the truck.  It should not, under any circumstances, be able to tip over when the child is getting out (or using the product in any other appropriate manner).  This is a serious design flaw that needs to be addressed immediately to prevent more kids from getting hurt.","Scappoose","Oregon",97056,"Home/Apartment/Condominium","Injury - Seen by Medical Professional","Male","My Child","2",Yes,No,,,No,Yes,Yes,"I still have the product.

The tricycle is designed to allow an adult to push the tricycle while a child is riding on it, so my husband was pushing the tricycle out of our driveway and into our residential street for its maiden voyage when the incident occurred just a short distance from our home.  While my husband was pushing the tricycle, my daughter placed her foot on the left pedal.  Although the tricycle is supposed to glide preventing the pedals from moving while the tricycle is being pushed, the pressure she applied to the left pedal engaged both pedals.  As a consequence, her right foot was grabbed by the moving right pedal.  Her foot became lodged in the space between the tire and the pedal (the zigzag metal piece that attaches the pedal to the tire) and was yanked forward.  After she began to cry, my husband immediately picked her up and brought her home.  Within about 20 minutes of the incident, we realized she could not support any weight/walk on her right foot.  We immediately took her to the urgent care clinic a few minutes from our home.  After the doctor examined the x-ray of her leg, we learned that she had suffered two buckle fractures--one on her tibia and the other on her fibula.  A splint was applied, and the next day she was fitted for a cast by an orthopedic doctor.  From the x-ray, the orthopedic doctor determined her foot did indeed get stuck in the space between the tire and the pedal and was subsequently twisted toward the right as the pedal moved--a traumatic experience for a 2 year old.  So far, she has been in a cast to immobilize her leg for almost three weeks with one more week to go before she is re-evaluated with a possible two more weeks in a new cast (at least four possibly 6-8 weeks in a cast). Obviously, there is a problem with the design of the tricycle since the pedals do not remain stationary when the tricycle is pushed by an adult and the child/rider touches the pedals.  Other tricycles have foot rests for the child to use while an adult is pushing.  With the Radio Flyer Steer and Stroll Trike, the child's legs are either left dangling near the supposedly stationary pedals or are resting on the pedals that could potentially move.  At any point during a ride, if the child applies pressure to a pedal and is not prepared for the other pedal to engage, an accident causing damage to a foot, ankle, or leg could occur no matter how old or experienced a rider the child is.  What makes the situation so much more dangerous is that the pedal is moving at the rate of the adult pushing it, which makes it difficult for a young child to catch up with the pedal.  Upon checking reviews of the tricycle since the incident, we sadly discovered we are not the only parents with a young child in a cast due to a broken leg caused by this tricycle.  With the advantage of hindsight, this is perhaps the most foolish design for a tricycle combining the strength and speed of a parent pushing the tricycle and the delicate legs of a child near pedals that could start spinning with the slightest pressure.

It is adorable to look at, and perfectly safe if she decides to ride in a perfectly straight line on flat ground. HOWEVER, this thing tips over and has caused my child many cuts and scrapes.DO NOT BUY. Get something that will not fall over and hurt your child. Here is another one: Bad Idea, We had a perfectly good wide based plastic trike that I replaced with this awful one. Grandma bought this Radio Flyer folding trike for my 2 year old for Christmas. I thought wow Radio Flyer! and donated the older trike. Now I am kicking myself. This Radio Flyer trike's base is not wide enough for a learner. It tips way too easily, even with just a slight turn of the handles. I keep it hidden away, so that she doesn't beg to use it very often. I only let her ride it when I am ready for heart stopping dash grabbing. I do not recommend this trike. It is not safe. here is the link for more reviews as well. http://www.amazon.com/Radio-Flyer-Girls-Fold-Trike/product-reviews/B001ULKVMU/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1As you can see it is a recurring issue and for a trike is not normal. Without being an Engineer I can tell you that the rear wheel base is too narrow, hence prompting tipping over all the time. It is truly not a safe product for the recommended age range and I can see a toddler not wearing a helmet getting seriously hurt.

I contacted keenz and was told that they see no issue with the wheel falling off that I should just put it back on. Every time I put it back on the thing falls back off.

All attempts of repairing it were unsuccessful.(08/2021) The consumer has a safety concern about the product. The consumer stated that the children were in the wagon and was being pulled by their parents. The nuts came off of the stabilizer rod causing the children  to fall out of the wagon.The consumer stated that he doesn't know if the children were injured. The parents told him about the incident.Addendum to report:Just before my granddaughter, [REDACTED], second birthday [REDACTED], I purchased a 100th Anniversary edition Radio Flyer (Town and Country Wagon). Not long after her parents began giving her rides around the neighborhood, the tie rod fell apart. With some effort, I was able to repair it, but the problem persisted. Her parents, [REDACTED], also tried to repair it, but it continued to fall apart. Eventually, in total frustration, they gave up and drove it to my house.I contacted Radio Flyer several times. It was only on my last attempt, that they ([REDACTED]) agreed to replace the original deck with a newly engineered version. They were prompt in keeping their promise, and within a week of our conversation I received the new deck, installed it and sent back the original one.The newly engineered deck, unlike the 100th Anniversary edition and two others that I own (an original, early 1990s Town & Country and an early 2000s [REDACTED] version-but it might be older than that), the tie rod was now internal. I do not know how much of an improvement it will be because my grandchildren have not been in it. And, unfortunately, my daughter, [REDACTED] (who rode in the 1990s version for YEARS), seems reluctant to take a chance on it.
