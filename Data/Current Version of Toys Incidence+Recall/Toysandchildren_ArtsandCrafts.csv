Should they change their mind we would very much like the chance to review the product, and would be happy to provide a good will exchange of product to them for their help to get us the product to review. We would like to ensure the product was as intended by design and product process controls.   This product line has been a popular line.  Since it was introduced in 2010, the line has sold over 8,750,000 units.  There have been a couple of versions of the product that used the crank mechanism to help a child form the dough into shapes.  These versions with the crank mechanism have sold almost 3 million units into the market.  The years of 2010 and 2011 were the popular years for the product line.  We have a call center, and the contact information to reach us is on the box and in the instructions, and we have an online site as well.  Since 2010 and the product’s introduction we have had less than a 0.05% contacts rate on the units sold. Since the product introduction in 2010, there has been only 1 prior contact about any type of similar incident on the crank mechanism.  There was no medical attention needed, and only minor home attention was used to resolve the incident. The child was okay without any follow up attention.  This is a 0.000034% call rate, based on the prior incident, and in that case the parent merely notified us of the case so we were aware.  I have provided to the CPSC online system 38 lab testing reports specific to this version product, for the USA mechanical, physical and chemical safety standards and requirements.  We use qualified, and registered with CPSC, third party labs that specialize in toy testing.  We have passed all the ASTM F 963 and CPSIA tests.  In addition to the USA requirement passing reports, we have passed all European and Canadian testing requirements.  Using Design Hazard Review to anticipate play patterns and potential concerns, we designed the crank mechanism intentionally to NOT catch or lock in place to prevent potential pinch injuries.  There is no electrical or other motor, so the user decides the speed and power used to drive the mechanism that is forming the dough shapes. This is specifically designed this way so that a child cranking the unit could NOT pinch a finger and jam the mechanism catching skin in place.  All edges are beveled and smoothed.  This is routinely monitored in the production process. We would have liked the opportunity to get the incident product unit back, to determine possible root causes of this incident.  We take reports of concern on our product very seriously.  In this case, the parent has chosen not to contact us directly.  At this time, based on the number of units on the market, our call center contacts, independent testing assessment and reports, as well as our own production controls and auditing, we believe the product is appropriate for use and meets or exceeds all applicable safety requirements.   We are always saddened to hear of a poor experience with a toy.  And we would be happy to exchange this product or help this customer should they contact us. Thank you",
