"Moon Bouncer Safety Alert",4/23/1996 ,"Moon Bouncer Safety Alert NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Media Relations April 23, 1996 (301) 504-7908 Release # 96-107 CPSC and Playskool Issue Safety Alert for Moon Bouncer WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Playskool of Pawtucket, R.I., is offering a free set of three gauges to help consumers properly inflate approximately 142,000 Durasport Moon Bouncers the company has already sold to consumers. If the Moon Bouncer is not correctly inflated, is overinflated, or is used on hard surfaces, children can be injured if they fall or bounce out of the toy. Playskool has received 22 reports of children falling or bouncing out of the Moon Bouncer, including ten injuries, four of them fractures. The Playskool Durasport Moon Bouncer is an inflatable vinyl toy designed for children ages three to six to bounce and jump in. Its red, circular base inflates to 5.5 feet in diameter. The side walls, resembling three stacked yellow rings, inflate to 16 inches from the jumping surface. Major discount stores in the United States and in Canada have sold the Moon Bouncers since November 1994 for about $60. Playskool warns parents and caregivers that proper inflation of the Moon Bouncer is critical. Incorrect inflation, particularly over-inflation of the Moon Bouncer's jumping surface, can make the Moon Bouncer unstable and cause children to fall or bounce out. Playskool also warns that the Moon Bouncer used outdoors should always be placed on impact-absorbing surfaces, such as sand or mulch. If used indoors, it should be placed on a padded surface. Carpet may not be sufficient to prevent injury. The Moon Bouncer should never be used on concrete, asphalt, wood, or other hard surfaces. Playskool is offering consumers a free set of gauges to help ensure that the toy is correctly inflated. Consumers can receive the inflation gauges and detailed inflation instructions by calling Playskool at (800) 752-9755, or by writing to Moon Bouncer, PO Box 200, Pawtucket, RI 02862-0200.",96107,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1996/CPSC-and-Playskool-Issue-Safety-Alert-for-Moon-Bouncer
