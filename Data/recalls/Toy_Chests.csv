"Toy Chest Warning by Jackson Furniture",2/25/1974 ,"Toy Chest Warning by Jackson Furniture NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE February 25, 1974 Release # 74-013 CPSC Warns Of Toy Chest Hazard WASHINGTON, D.C.(Feb. 25) --The Consumer Product Safety Commission today urged purchasers of a particular toy chest to return the chests to the retailer where they were purchased for a full refund. The toy chests, manufactured by the Jackson Furniture Corporation, Jackson, Tenn., were sold by 40 retailers, including Sears, Roebuck and Company, who sold the chest through its catalog. Tile action came after the chests were reportedly associated with the death of one child and serious injury to another in separate incidents. The accidents apparently resulted from the children's heads being caught between the front of the case and the top of the chest. Some 13,000 of the chests were manufactured by Jackson Furniture, and 95 percent were sold through the Sears catalog during the past four years. The Consumer Product Safety Commission believes most of these are still in the hands of consumers. The CPSC notified Jackson Furniture Corporation and Sears last November 7 that the chest was involved in the accidents. The death occurred September 3, 1973, and the serious injury January 1972. Jackson discontinued production, and Sears took the items off sale November 21. Jackson issued a national announcement on November 26 advising its retailers to take the chest off sale. The Sears chests can be identified by their padded 3-inch top and come in three colors--yellow, orange, and walnut finish-- with a side print design of lambs and daisies. The Sears catalog listed the chest under model numbers 88063, 88064, and 88065. Sears will continue to refund the full price of the chest in accordance with company policy. A redesigned chest with a lighter and flat lid is now being sold in the Sears catalog. This redesigned chest is not involved in the above action. The Jackson Furniture Corporation, who sold similar chests to 39 other retailers, stated that it will refund the full wholesale price to retailers for return of the chests. The chests are identical in construction to the Sears chests except for a pale yellow metal frame with sides and top decorations in a series of white, green, and yellow circles and star patterns. The name of Jackson Furniture Corporation is located on a fixed tag inside the chest. The chests are listed by Stock No. 9023 which is stamped on the packing carton but not on the chest itself. The CPSC has commended Sears and the Jackson Furniture Corporation for their action.",74013,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1974/CPSC-Warns-Of-Toy-Chest-Hazard

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: Originally issued March 27, 1991; Revised July 10, 2001 (301) 504-7908 Release # 91-054 Decorator Cube Safety Warning WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, (CPSC), Seward Luggage Company of Petersburg, VA; Trojan Luggage of Memphis, TN; and Mercury Luggage Manufacturing Co. of Jacksonville, FL, today, issued a warning about a strangulation and suffocation hazard when decorator cubes with hinged lids manufactured prior to June 30, 1990 are used to store toys or children's belongings. These cubes, distributed nationwide during the past 2 1/2 years, are 16 X 16 X 16 cubed-shaped trunks with hinged lids decorated with various scenes and motifs. Decorator cubes manufactured after June 30, 1990 have removable lids. The decorator cubes may be appropriately used for storage and as a home furnishing. The cubes may present a strangulation hazard if the lid falls on the neck of a young child who is reaching into the trunk for a toy or other item. CPSC believes young children under the age of six years are at the greatest risk of injury. It was reported that a 14-month-old child died when a cube's lid allegedly fell on him. In addition, a young child could climb into a cube, become trapped inside and suffocate if the lid shuts. Approximately 2.2 million cubes have been distributed nationally by the three firms between 1987 and June 30, 1990. To prevent the possibility of strangulation or suffocation: Owners should remove the metal pin (used to hold the hinge together) from each of the two hinges, thereby making the lid removable. Owners of cubes who choose not to remove lids will be supplied with lid spacer clamps that will prevent the lid from slamming shut and a warning label to remind users of the potential hazards. Consumers should call 1-800-766-9417 to obtain free, easily installed spacer clamps, a warning label and further information if necessary, on the removal of the hinge pin.

PROBLEM: In separate incidents, three children allegedly strangled when the cube's lid fell on their necks. The cubes also pose a suffocation hazard if a young child becomes trapped inside the cube with the lid closed because the cube does not have ventilation holes. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has issued two previous warnings regarding the decorator cubes and is again alerting the public because approximately 4,500 hinged lid cubes were distributed, inadvertently, by Seward Luggage Company during the recall program. Also, CPSC and Seward Luggage Company are attempting to increase consumer awareness about the potential hazards. These cubes may still be in hands of consumers or in the marketplace at liquidation centers and flea markets. WHAT TO DO: Consumers who have these cubes should call 1-800-766-9417 to obtain a free modification kit. Consumers who see the hinged lid cubes being sold should report the location to the Commission at 1-800-638-2772. BACKGROUND: The decorator cubes with hinged lids were the subject of a corrective action first announced by CPSC on March 27, 1991. The manufacturers of the cubes (Seward Luggage Company, Petersburg, VA; Trojan Luggage, Memphis, TN; and Mercury Luggage Manufacturing Company, Jacksonville, FL) are still attempting to notify consumers of the continued risk so the cubes can be modified. Decorator cubes manufactured after June 1990 have removable lids (no hinges) and are not subject to this warning",92122,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1992/Three-Children-Killed-By-Decorator-Cubes
