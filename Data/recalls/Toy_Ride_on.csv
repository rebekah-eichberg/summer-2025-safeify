"Power Wheels Porsche Battery-Powered Riding Automobile For Children Recalled",10/25/1991 ,"October 25, 1991 Release # 92-008 Power Wheels Porsche Battery-Powered Riding Automobile For Children Recalled WASHINGTON, DC -- In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), Kransco Power Wheels of San Francisco, CA is voluntarily recalling the children's Power Wheels Porsche riding automobile which is powered by a rechargeable 18-volt battery. The automobile moves forward by pressing a foot pedal and stops when the pedal is released. A spring-loaded switch beneath the pedal is depressed to activate the motor. The recalled automobiles are equipped with a stronger, 18-volt battery system which, unlike the 12-volt battery used in previous models, may cause the switch's contact points to weld together during the initial surge of electricity. If this were to happen, the motor would remain running and the vehicle would continue moving forward, unable to stop. The CPSC was informed of this potential hazard by Kransco who discovered the problem when field testing the vehicle. The Power Wheels Porsche automobiles were distributed to retailers beginning August 21, 1991. On October 11, 1991, Kransco issued a voluntary recall to retailers of all 18-volt vehicles shipped as of that date. Approximately 12,000 vehicles were sold to retailers and the company estimates that about 1,000 units were sold to consumers. The vehicles sold for approximately $359-399 each. Owners of the affected units should stop use immediately. Consumers are asked to contact the company's customer service department at 1-800-348-0751 for instructions on how to disable the vehicle. Consumers will be sent a replacement switch which can be installed at home. Consumers are also given the option of returning the unit to one of the company's 260 nationwide service centers for the repair to be completed by an authorized service center employee. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission joins Kransco in announcing this repair program as part of its mission to insure that products purchased by American consumers are safe",92008,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1992/Power-Wheels-Porsche-Battery-Powered-Riding-Automobile-For-Children-Recalled
