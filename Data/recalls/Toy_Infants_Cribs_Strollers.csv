"Musical Computer Toys Recalled by Tiger",5/2/1984 ,"Musical Computer Toys Recalled by Tiger NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 2, 1984 Release # 84-029 Tiger Electronics Hippo-Lot-O-Fun Musical Computer Toy May Present Hazard To Infants And Small Children Washington, D.C. -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced that a musical computer crib and toddler toy, the HIPPO-LOT-O-FUN Musical Computer Toy, Model No. 7-511, distributed by Tiger Electronic Toys, Inc., 909 East Orchard, Mundelein, Illinois 60060, may present choking and ingestion hazards because of a small knob which can be pulled off. This toy is battery operated and constructed of plastic in the shape of a hippopotamus, with straps for attachment to a crib or playpen and includes a handle for carrying. When the buttons are pushed, knobs twisted or moved and/or dials turned, the toy plays various tunes, makes noises or lights UP. A blue decal with white lettering on the front of the toy reads Tiger Electronic Toys HIPPO-LOT-O-FUN. The toy is approximately 16 long by 7 high by 1 l/4 thick. When the Commission tested this toy according to safety requirements for toys, a sliding knob pulled off. This is in contradiction of the CPSC Small Parts Requirement which prohibits small parts in toys intended for children under three years of age. CPSC has determined that this knob is small enough to present possible choking and ingestion hazards to children under three years of age. The Commission is aware of one incident involving a 15-month-old child who accidentally ingested the sliding knob from this toy. The mother was able to remove the knob from the back of the child's mouth and medical attention was not required. No other accidental ingestion incident has been reported. Tiger Electronic Toys, Inc., engaged the services of an independent engineering firm to also conduct safety testing. Although the toy failed the Small Parts Requirements, when tested under actual use conditions in a children's nursery, the children tested could not dislodge the sliding knob. Nevertheless, Tiger Electronic Toys, Inc., has elected to cooperate with the Commission to conclude the matter. Tiger distributed approximately 15,000 of these toys nationally from 1980 through 1982. The toys sold for about $20.00. Consumers should remove these toys from use and return them directly to the company. Tiger is prepared to offer in exchange a SELECT-O-FUN Musical Computer Toy, Model No. 7-511.

"Baby Toy Warning",10/17/1989 ,"Baby Toy Warning NEWS from CPSC U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE CONTACT: OCTOBER 17, 1989 (301) 504-7908 Release # 90-001 Baby Toy Warning WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as a precaution, is issuing a warning on the Shelcore 8 in 1 Play Center with four corner holes manufactured prior to 1988. Play Centers manufactured after July, 1988 do not contain four corner holes and are not subject to this notice. Consumers are warned not to attach the Play Center by strings to a crib or playpen. If strings are not tied tightly or become loosened with use, the string between the toy and the crib may present a potential strangulation hazard if a child places his neck over the excess string. The Company never received a consumer complaint or report of injury associated with this product. The Play Center, model No. 61012, measures approximately 10 inches by 10 inches by one inch and contains four corner holes and eight multi-colored, eight-sided individual toys which can be pulled out and played with separately. The toy was designed for children between the ages of nine to 36 months. The toys were sold nationwide for about $8.50 each. To date, approximately 400,000 units have been sold. Attachment to a mesh-sided playpen is more dangerous than to a wooden crib or playpen since the flexible mesh creates a greater potential for entrapment. In July, 1988, Shelcore, Inc. redesigned the product without corner holes so it cannot be attached to anything. Play centers which do not contain four corner holes are not subject to this warning. Consumers who have attached the Play Center to a crib or playpen by strings should immediately cut and throw away the strings. The toy can still be used safely on the floor of a crib or playpen.",90001,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1990/Baby-Toy-Warning

In late March the Company received a report that a one-year old child died when a hooded sweater became entangled on a #155 Play Gym. A previous death was reported in May 1980 due to a child's clothing catching on a Play Gym. In 1981, Fisher-Price voluntarily began labeling this crib toy to warn parents to remove the Play Gym from their child's crib when he is able to push up on hands and knees or reached 5 months of age. A child who can push up on hands and knees while wearing loose clothing or any stringlike material around the neck may become entangled on the Play Gym or other similar toys that attach across a crib. There may be unlabeled Play Gyms still in use. Therefore, the Commission and Fisher-Price are issuing this alert and urging parents to remove these toys from cribs and playpens as soon as their child begins to push up on hands and knees. The Commission and Fisher-Price also advise parents against putting children in cribs while the infants are wearing hooded clothing or any loose-fitting garments that could become entangled about a child's neck. Consumers outside of New York State who have questions may call Fisher-Price directly on a toll-free line: 1-800-233-4004.

(August 7, 1980) -- The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission today announced that approximately 8,000 elastic crib decorations known as Kickers are being recalled voluntarily by their manufacturer. CPSC staff believes that the decorations may pose a strangulation hazard to infants. The recall is being conducted in cooperation with CPSC to prevent any potential strangulation, although no injuries have been reported to the Commission or the manufacturer. Each Kicker crib decoration, manufactured by Rainbow Artisans, Inc., of Livingston, New Jersey, consists of four or five soft-sculptured fabric designs strung on a white elastic cord. A plastic ring is attached to each end of the elastic cord so that the decoration may be stretched across a crib or baby carriage and tied to the sides with ribbons. The crib decorations are manufactured in such a way that, if kicked or handled by an infant, the fabric designs may slide from one side of the elastic cord to the other. Such actions may expose enough elastic cord to present a potential strangulation hazard if parents place the product too close to the infant, according to CPSC staff. The Kickers being recalled were manufactured from January, 1977, through January, 1980, and were sold nationwide for approximately $12 in retail and specialty stores. Consumers who own this product may obtain a free repair kit by cutting the elastic cord, removing the fabric designs and mailing only the cord and plastic rings to: Rainbow Artisans, Inc., 19 Troy Drive, Livingston, New Jersey 07039.
