    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook computes semantic similarity scores between Amazon product reviews and reference complaint or shipping-related sentences using sentence embeddings. It also incorporates sentiment analysis to improve the precision of similarity-based filtering. The resulting features are aggregated at the product level.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Loads Amazon reviews with precomputed embeddings from `amazon_reviews_with_embeddings.parquet` (generated by `EmbeddingCalculationReviewText.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Computes the similarity scores of the review text with a collection of reference complaint sentences (`sentences_complaint.pkl`). This uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`. We also calculate the similarity score between review text and a set of shipping-related complaint sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We use a sentiment classifier (`distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) to compute sentiment scores for each review. To reduce false positives, we filter out reviews with high similarity but positive sentiment to the complaint sentences, in order to reduce false positives.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We aggregates mean and maximum similarity and sentiment scores per ASIN, and compute weighted and mean review embeddings per ASIN, giving more weight to negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We then save the final product-level features and embeddings to `Data/review_features_df.pkl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "- `amazon_reviews_with_embeddings.parquet` (Amazon reviews with sentence embeddings)\n",
    "- `sentences_complaint.pkl` (reference complaint sentences)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output Files\n",

Upon closer inspection, I noticed parts that seemed cracked or wet, possibly from a toxic or excessive chemical leak. My doctor advised a checkup after I developed irritation, and the specialist mentioned possible exposure to a carcinogen. I also saw rusted metal and a joint that had become loose, potentially leading to an internal hazard. It even skidded on smooth surfaces, and at one point got wedged under a cabinet. I sent a pic to support, but the response was delayed. This whole process was uncomfortable, and honestly, the product's failure left me feeling unsafe and frustrated.\"\n",
    "sentence31 = \"I want to issue a serious warning about this product. It posed multiple hazards and could potentially be dangerous under normal use. While following all instructions, I experienced a rash that later turned infected, possibly due to a contaminated coating or poor manufacturing. The item had visible fragment damage and arrived from a questionable batch, emitting a fishy smell that didn’t seem okay. During use, a piece suddenly split, and I nearly tripped, injuring my shoulder. The situation was upsetting enough that I contacted an attorney, and I’m currently investigating whether a teratogen or other harmful substance was involved. My doctor mentioned GI issues could be linked. I also noticed sharp barbs near the attachment point, and the vinyl edges were poorly sealed. The unit would shake uncontrollably on acceleration, making operation unsafe. My eardrum felt strained from a sudden boom sound, and I had to schedule an extraction due to an object blocking my nostril. Honestly, the experience has been a complete disaster, and it ought to be declared unfit for sale. I’ve saved the product, the decal, and even the knife used to open the package in case I need to settle this through legal means. I’d strongly advise others to avoid this item entirely. It's not just poorly made, it’s lethality without warning.\"\n",
    "sentence31 = \"After purchasing this item, I had a truly unsettling experience. I was preparing dinner and attempted to remove the lid, but it was jammed so tightly I had to tilt and pry it off, which led to a sudden faceplant as the container slipped. I pinched my hand in the process and spilled part of the frozen contents across the floor. The included packet of seasoning smelled bitter, and after cooking, I noticed the meat had a strange misshapen texture and an off taste. Within hours, I felt sick, with abdominal cramping and redness forming around my mouth — likely an allergic reaction. I checked the use-by date and realized it had passed. I’ve since submitted a complaint and requested the product be replaced, but the process has been frustrating. I feel this could have been a deadlydanger for someone with more severe allergies. The entire situation was terrifying — from the injury while opening it to the symptoms that followed. Honestly, the quality and safety of this product are unacceptable.\"\n",
    "sentence13 = \"I had an awful experience with this product and want to warn others. It was advertised as sturdy and safe, but that’s far from the truth. Shortly after unboxing, I noticed parts were rusted and chipped, and some metal components had started to flake. While using it, the mechanism suddenly jammed, and when I tried to adjust it, it abruptly collapsed, causing me to injure my ankle. The pain was intense enough that I later had to visit a neurologist due to nerve issues from the scrapes and swelling. Even worse, the smell of smoke emerged after brief use, and I had to immediately unplug it. I contacted a representative, but they simply told me to return the item without offering support or concern. It felt inevitable that someone would get seriously hurt using this. At one point, I even dropped it near my child, and one of the sharp parts nearly slit the surface of our posterior cabinet. I’m honestly afraid of using anything similar again — the risk of a crash or breakdown is just too high. Products like this should undergo more thorough safety checks before being sold.\"\n",
    "sentence17 = \"I had a terrible experience that left me deeply disappointed and honestly a little shaken. After just a few uses, the product began to malfunction, and a sharp edge cut my finger while trying to disassemble it for cleaning. The injury bled more than expected, and I had to visit emergency care. I was told the wound might result in a permanent scar. Even before that, parts had become sticky, and the material gave off a scenty, almost petroleum-like odor that irritated my skin. Shortly after storing it, a piece shattered near the axle, nearly hitting me in the chest. It’s shocking that a product with such volatile materials is allowed on the market. I’ve now removed it completely from my home and am trying to get it recalled. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone — it’s a threat to safety, and the company should take professional responsibility for the painful consequences I’ve endured. I’ll be much more cautious in the future and urge others to stay away.\"\n",

      "I bought this product last year for a Halloween party for kids aging from 7-11.  The kids did have fun with it, however, two kids at the party had a reaction to the bubbles.  One girls face was itching and turning red in spots where the bubble hit her face and more alarming was that another boy had what looked like a chemical burn (almost blistering) on his cheek that burned.  I washed his face immediately.  I did not take him to the dr. because it wasn't getting larger and seemed to be getting better in a few days I believe it was.  But there was no warning of this.  I left a message on the companys answering machine and they called me the first thing in the morning that they opened.  They said they never heard anything like this because it is used worldwide.  I also sent them a picture of the boys cheek that was affected.  They were very good about this and had me return the bottle and paid the purchase price and the shipping for returning it.  I was hoping by now they would have put something up of some warning, maybe because I didn't go to the dr. that is why.  I showed a few nurses at church his face, and they agreed that it looked like a chemical burn.  I just want anyone out there to be careful of this product if they choose to use it.  The kids did love to play with it.  Also one of my mistakes when they played with it, is to make sure you have florescent black lights not just a black lightbulb...at least I had one flourescent bulb.

We bought this for my son's birthday so we didn't open it until after the 30 day return policy was up so now I'm stuck with this thing that will most likely end up in the trash.

      "I bought this product last year for a Halloween party for kids aging from 7-11.  The kids did have fun with it, however, two kids at the party had a reaction to the bubbles.  One girls face was itching and turning red in spots where the bubble hit her face and more alarming was that another boy had what looked like a chemical burn (almost blistering) on his cheek that burned.  I washed his face immediately.  I did not take him to the dr. because it wasn't getting larger and seemed to be getting better in a few days I believe it was.  But there was no warning of this.  I left a message on the companys answering machine and they called me the first thing in the morning that they opened.  They said they never heard anything like this because it is used worldwide.  I also sent them a picture of the boys cheek that was affected.  They were very good about this and had me return the bottle and paid the purchase price and the shipping for returning it.  I was hoping by now they would have put something up of some warning, maybe because I didn't go to the dr. that is why.  I showed a few nurses at church his face, and they agreed that it looked like a chemical burn.  I just want anyone out there to be careful of this product if they choose to use it.  The kids did love to play with it.  Also one of my mistakes when they played with it, is to make sure you have florescent black lights not just a black lightbulb...at least I had one flourescent bulb.  Great product if there is no side effects.\n",

      "We have 9 month old twin girls who liked this mirror. Seemed like a safe toy but this morning I heard one of them coughing and when I investigated I found the stitching had come undone along the side, exposing wads of the extremely fine fibrous padding material used to line the side. My daughter had a large piece of this in her mouth, which had blocked her airway and she had started choking. Only by good fortune had I heard her coughing and was able to get the material out of her mouth, which revealed a matted string had extended into her throat, causing the choking response.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my view this could have been a fatal incident. I believe this happened because of poor manufacturing standards. The padding material should have been encased in a protective sleeve, and the stitching on the hem of the mirror should have been of a much more robust nature. It's important to note that the toy had not been abused, and I would describe the usage as pretty low. Certainly far below the point the product would start to disintegrate.\n",

My box was thin but not damaged the product itself was damaged in several areas see photos, the aroma from the game is awful it filled a 3k foot house in minutes it's that strong. As others have said when dropping chips it's very LOUD. Dropping or removing the chips requires you to remove and lift up on the bottom wood bar and it sticks so not easy but not all that hard but for younger children it would be a bigger challenge.

    "\n",
    "While computing similarity scores between review embeddings and a complaint-related reference vector helped identify potential safety issues, we observed false positives: several reviews with high similarity scores were actually positive in sentiment. These reviews often mentioned terms like \"product\", \"damage\" or \"issue\" in a non-negative context.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we incorporated a sentiment classification layer. For reviews classified as positive, we set their similarity score to zero, ensuring that reviews with high semantic similarity but positive tone are not mistakenly flagged. This hybrid approach improves our model’s precision by filtering out irrelevant matches that share complaint-related vocabulary but not complaint-related intent.\n"

      "I bought this product last year for a Halloween party for kids aging from 7-11.  The kids did have fun with it, however, two kids at the party had a reaction to the bubbles.  One girls face was itching and turning red in spots where the bubble hit her face and more alarming was that another boy had what looked like a chemical burn (almost blistering) on his cheek that burned.  I washed his face immediately.  I did not take him to the dr. because it wasn't getting larger and seemed to be getting better in a few days I believe it was.  But there was no warning of this.  I left a message on the companys answering machine and they called me the first thing in the morning that they opened.  They said they never heard anything like this because it is used worldwide.  I also sent them a picture of the boys cheek that was affected.  They were very good about this and had me return the bottle and paid the purchase price and the shipping for returning it.  I was hoping by now they would have put something up of some warning, maybe because I didn't go to the dr. that is why.  I showed a few nurses at church his face, and they agreed that it looked like a chemical burn.  I just want anyone out there to be careful of this product if they choose to use it.  The kids did love to play with it.  Also one of my mistakes when they played with it, is to make sure you have florescent black lights not just a black lightbulb...at least I had one flourescent bulb.  Great product if there is no side effects.\n",

      "We have 9 month old twin girls who liked this mirror. Seemed like a safe toy but this morning I heard one of them coughing and when I investigated I found the stitching had come undone along the side, exposing wads of the extremely fine fibrous padding material used to line the side. My daughter had a large piece of this in her mouth, which had blocked her airway and she had started choking. Only by good fortune had I heard her coughing and was able to get the material out of her mouth, which revealed a matted string had extended into her throat, causing the choking response.\n",

The padding material should have been encased in a protective sleeve, and the stitching on the hem of the mirror should have been of a much more robust nature.

As others have said when dropping chips it's very LOUD.

      "This product has a twist motion for on and off. My 10 yr. old son was trying to turn it off and the toy popped open and what looked like rusty water sprayed out of this toy and he now has 2nd degree burns on his face, in his mouth and on his neck. Burn specialists at the ER said the battery was still intact so it is hard to determine what caused the burns. When contacting the company a supervisor did return my phone call, but did not seem interested in my situation. They stated that no complaints such as these have been reported. I insisted that they should take every complaint seriously in order to prevent any other child from being injured. Now just hoping my son's face heals.\n",
