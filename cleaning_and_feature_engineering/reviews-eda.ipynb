Such a waste.\n\nI don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these \"kinds of adventures\" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.\n\nSame thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.\n\nThey really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.\n\nThe Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.\n\nThis Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.

         "My review will mirror others in that this kind of misses the mark and there are some lost opportunities to help DM's.  I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.\nI do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.\nHowever, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.\nOn a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)\n\nI can understand the idea and desire to produce tailored DM Screens for these adventure books, but I don't feel they've truly taken the time to get feedback on their ideas from enough sources before printing.

         "Pretty good book with a variety of unique card sleights (palming, manipulating cards in the deck, etc.). These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.\nThe instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.\nSometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).\nRight now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.\nIf you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",

         "When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!\nI have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.\nThat being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, \"Card Experiments\". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.\nAnd there is SO much different good stuff in here, that you'll probably never need another book for advanced materials.\nIt is a great book and a great reference to help you on your way to card excellence and showmanship. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",

Seriously, this is a truly excellent book.  Buckley's sleights, though not for the faint of heart, are superb.  (He must've been one heckuva cardician!) This is a serious, serious card magic book.  But if you are serious yourself, you'll get it.  Of course, you'll overlook the antiquated prose and Buckley's tremendous ego throughout.  (When you read this material you'll forgive Buckley's self-congratulatory tone.) This is a splendid work for those who want to be the best...",

Once again, you've created a single use screen that is only useful when running the \"Storm King's Thunder\" adventure. Even despite the fact that it's geared to that adventure path, it's usefulness negligible, at best. I massive swath of the inner panel is wasted on artwork and a bloated overland map, which could have been easily reduced to a single panel in size.

Such a waste.\n\nI don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these \"kinds of adventures\" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.\n\nSame thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.\n\nThey really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.\n\nThe Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.\n\nThis Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.  Maybe they should ask a few DMs what they would use?",

         "Just play the computer game.  This game is long, contains hundreds of little cardboard bits (but not enough of certain ones), and has way too many rules.  If you like games with those values, it is a good game.  I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.  The rules are VERY well crafted, there were no \"rule says this, no it doesn't\" fights.  For as many as there are, they were straight forward and easy to understand.  But good mechanics do not change the tedious nature of the game play.  We spent 6 hours playing the 30 rounds of the game, and I left before the PVP section started.\n\nOne thing that really needs to change is the way the blue monsters are handled.  Only quests give you anything and blue monsters aren't associated with quests, so everyone avoids them and they become pointless roadblocks everywhere.\n\nFor the price, the minis should have been painted.  They are well sculpted but many were badly molded and trimmed.  The Wizards minis are farm better quality.\n\nThis game is made by the same company that did Arkham Horror, and they are rather similar.  WOW has better rules, but Arkham Horror is far more fun (subjectively speaking, that one still takes forever too but I enjoy it much more)."

Such a waste.\n\nI don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these \"kinds of adventures\" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.\n\nSame thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.\n\nThey really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.\n\nThe Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.\n\nThis Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.  Maybe they should ask a few DMs what they would use?",

         "My review will mirror others in that this kind of misses the mark and there are some lost opportunities to help DM's.  I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.\nI do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.\nHowever, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.\nOn a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)\n\nI can understand the idea and desire to produce tailored DM Screens for these adventure books, but I don't feel they've truly taken the time to get feedback on their ideas from enough sources before printing.

         "Pretty good book with a variety of unique card sleights (palming, manipulating cards in the deck, etc.). These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.\nThe instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.\nSometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).\nRight now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.\nIf you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",

         "When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!\nI have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.\nThat being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, \"Card Experiments\". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.\nAnd there is SO much different good stuff in here, that you'll probably never need another book for advanced materials.\nIt is a great book and a great reference to help you on your way to card excellence and showmanship. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",

Seriously, this is a truly excellent book.  Buckley's sleights, though not for the faint of heart, are superb.  (He must've been one heckuva cardician!) This is a serious, serious card magic book.  But if you are serious yourself, you'll get it.  Of course, you'll overlook the antiquated prose and Buckley's tremendous ego throughout.

         "I purchased this microscope at Toys R Us, where it was not on display; only in the box on the shelf.  Had I been able to look at it and handle it up close, I would have experienced what a cheap product this is.  This microscope is as lightweight as any plastic toy because that's what it is made out of; nearly entirely of plastic.  Not what I expect in a microscope, and certainly not for almost $100.  The product description claims that the lenses are glass, but that is hard to believe, as not anything could be seen through them.\n\nNot one specimen could be brought into focus on any of the magnifications...neither any of the prepared slides that were included, nor any \"fresh\" slides we made like pond water or a stem cross-section.  We were lucky if we even got a blurred shadow of the specimen in our field of vision.\n\nI feel so silly that I was fooled by this company's packaging design strategy.  The microscope comes with a very professional-looking case and many scientific-looking tools and equipment.  At first glance it seems like you're getting a good value, but as soon as you pick up the microscope you'll realize you've been had.  This is so not worth it.  If your child would like a microscope, go to Carolina Biological Supply for one that is slightly higher priced but MUCH higher quality and actually useable.",

After a few minutes I quickly realized how awful it was. Simply by adjusting the focus the plastic stand bends out of shape and slowly moves back somewhere to its original position. The 150x power lens worked but no matter what I tried I could not view anything through the two higher powered lenses. This should not be sold at all and is a quick way for kids to loose interest in science. Its very sad.",

They require a cardboard piece in between the paths and they do not hold together even with the removable tape that is included. It might be usable if you used duct tape underneath but then you wouldn't be able to take it apart or rearrange the pieces. The company obviously knew it was faulty as they added the tape and extra instructions apart from the regular instructions. Extremely disappointing! I couldn't even get it together long enough to add the thin plastic strips that serve as the walls. I just piled it up and am leaving it for my husband to try to put together. Not worth the money I paid, not sure it would be worth my time if it were free! It would probably be better using a plastic ball or the zhu zhu pets arena.",

         "I have never been so disappointed in or frustrated by a toy. My 5 year old really wanted this, and even used his own money he saved to buy this. The track is merely thin strips of cardboard. It is supposed to hold together like puzzle pieces, but does not remotely stick together. You put two pieces together in one place and it slips out somewhere else. After 20 minutes fruitlessly trying to assemble a track, it just kept coming apart. I told my son we could tape it with strong packing tape on the backside, but then the whole \"interchangeable\" aspect become mute.  In the box, they included 2 small pages of \"removable tape\" squares (clearly an afterthought), but these proved to be about as effective as a small post it note holding the pieces together. They just got crumbled up in between the pieces. Even my 5 year old realized it was terrible, and not at all what he thought it would be. He said \"Mommy, it doesn't look anything like it does on TV, \" and was so disappointed.  He left for a while and I continued to work on this darn thing to try to make him happy. The edges are straight plastic strips that are supposed to bend and stick vertically into slits along the edges of the cardboard track. They do not work. Not in the slightest. If you try to curve them, guess what happens? The pressure pushes out the track. The frustration I felt attempting this about made me lose my mind. I finally got it to a point where a mini-track was sort of half done, and my son came back in. I warned him it was very fragile and to try not to touch it.  (Ridiculous instructions to play with a toy, huh??) Needless to say, once you put the moving bugs on it for 15 seconds, it all rips apart. Beyond disappointing. Save your money. The only \"positive\" in this whole experience was a decent lesson for my son about the falseness of toy commercials.  (This from a former advertising art director!)  The bugs are fine, he enjoys them. Use them on a train table with edges, use some blocks as obstacles and create bug mazes... works a whole lot better and is a lot more fun than this fragile nightmare.",

Anyway, instead of waiting to lose my temper with it on Christmas Day, I opened the box and hit on a great idea. I bought a meter-square piece of MDF, got some wood glue and stuck one of the arena designs to it. Okay, wrecks the interchangeability thing but as long as my six-year-old son never sees the box, never sees the other discarded pieces, and never sees the instruction sheet, he'll never know there was so much more. Which, of course, is a myth anyway. If you did manage to put this together without glue, hammer and nails, G-clamps and vices, you sure wouldn't want to take it apart again. Better some of the pieces stuck on MDF than all of the pieces on the bonfire. All I need now is another house big enough to hide a meter-square piece of MDF without an inquisitive six-year-old finding it.

These are my sons words (he is 7 years old): \"I feel really sad and this company makes really bad toys. It looks really bad and it really makes me angry. And I can't believe that it came with tape. It should just fit together. And I really don't know why they're still selling it.\" My 5 year old daughter says, \"I am really really angry because it doesn't stick together.\" As another reviewer stated, this is a very good lesson for my children. They now understand that some companies are more interested in making money than providing good quality products for children. I only wish I read the reviews prior to purchasing. I learned a lesson too.",
