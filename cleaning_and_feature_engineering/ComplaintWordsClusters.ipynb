Upon closer inspection, I noticed parts that seemed cracked or wet, possibly from a toxic or excessive chemical leak. My doctor advised a checkup after I developed irritation, and the specialist mentioned possible exposure to a carcinogen.

While following all instructions, I experienced a rash that later turned infected, possibly due to a contaminated coating or poor manufacturing. The item had visible fragment damage and arrived from a questionable batch, emitting a fishy smell that didn’t seem okay. During use, a piece suddenly split, and I nearly tripped, injuring my shoulder. The situation was upsetting enough that I contacted an attorney, and I’m currently investigating whether a teratogen or other harmful substance was involved. My doctor mentioned GI issues could be linked. I also noticed sharp barbs near the attachment point, and the vinyl edges were poorly sealed. The unit would shake uncontrollably on acceleration, making operation unsafe. My eardrum felt strained from a sudden boom sound, and I had to schedule an extraction due to an object blocking my nostril. Honestly, the experience has been a complete disaster, and it ought to be declared unfit for sale. I’ve saved the product, the decal, and even the knife used to open the package in case I need to settle this through legal means. I’d strongly advise others to avoid this item entirely. It's not just poorly made, it’s lethality without warning.\"\n",

I was preparing dinner and attempted to remove the lid, but it was jammed so tightly I had to tilt and pry it off, which led to a sudden faceplant as the container slipped. I pinched my hand in the process and spilled part of the frozen contents across the floor. The included packet of seasoning smelled bitter, and after cooking, I noticed the meat had a strange misshapen texture and an off taste. Within hours, I felt sick, with abdominal cramping and redness forming around my mouth — likely an allergic reaction. I checked the use-by date and realized it had passed. I’ve since submitted a complaint and requested the product be replaced, but the process has been frustrating. I feel this could have been a deadlydanger for someone with more severe allergies. The entire situation was terrifying — from the injury while opening it to the symptoms that followed. Honestly, the quality and safety of this product are unacceptable.\"\n",

Shortly after unboxing, I noticed parts were rusted and chipped, and some metal components had started to flake. While using it, the mechanism suddenly jammed, and when I tried to adjust it, it abruptly collapsed, causing me to injure my ankle. The pain was intense enough that I later had to visit a neurologist due to nerve issues from the scrapes and swelling. Even worse, the smell of smoke emerged after brief use, and I had to immediately unplug it. I contacted a representative, but they simply told me to return the item without offering support or concern. It felt inevitable that someone would get seriously hurt using this. At one point, I even dropped it near my child, and one of the sharp parts nearly slit the surface of our posterior cabinet. I’m honestly afraid of using anything similar again — the risk of a crash or breakdown is just too high. Products like this should undergo more thorough safety checks before being sold.\"\n",

After just a few uses, the product began to malfunction, and a sharp edge cut my finger while trying to disassemble it for cleaning. The injury bled more than expected, and I had to visit emergency care. I was told the wound might result in a permanent scar. Even before that, parts had become sticky, and the material gave off a scenty, almost petroleum-like odor that irritated my skin. Shortly after storing it, a piece shattered near the axle, nearly hitting me in the chest. It’s shocking that a product with such volatile materials is allowed on the market. I’ve now removed it completely from my home and am trying to get it recalled. I wouldn’t wish this on anyone — it’s a threat to safety, and the company should take professional responsibility for the painful consequences I’ve endured.

I tried to adhere to all instructions, but the product was clearly unbalanced and unsafe. While operating it, a sharp component came loose and lacerated my eyelid, resulting in excruciating pain. I had to be taken in for an x-ray and later saw an ophthalmologist, who expressed concern about long-term damage. I attempted to seek resolution and asked the company for a refund, but they only apologized without taking responsibility. They didn’t mention any warning on the packaging, even though this should have been reported to the CPSC. The whole situation left me with ongoing anxiety and symptoms resembling PTSD — I’m still shaken. This kind of negligence is unacceptable. A product that causes this level of harm should be removed from the market asap. I hope my complaint helps mitigate future risk for others.\"\n",

After brief use, I noticed signs of corrosion near a valve, possibly caused by residual sodium chloride buildup. The product gave off a strange smell — almost like combustion — and the surface became hot, causing overheatingthe unit. My partner, who is breastfeeding, experienced a fever shortly afterward, and we’re now waiting on a medical prognosis. I later learned the material may contain carcinogenic components and wasn’t suitable for homes with older residents or infants. The manufacturer completely overlooked the risks associated with exposure. I reached out to demand an explanation and was told the situation didn’t pertain to them since I had taken ownership weeks ago. As someone with a PhD in chemical safety, I find that response unacceptable. There was no warning, no clear documentation, and no conversation about possible residuals.

I thought maybe it was just my unit, but after reading more, it’s apparent that this isn't an isolated issue. I experienced mild irritation on my hands, and my partner, who has asthma, complained about the fumes. One of the metal pieces even gave me a slight scrape while I was cleaning it. This kind of defect should’ve been caught before distribution. I tried to contact support but got no real help — just a vague mention of the warranty and no offer to replace it.

One of the metal rods started to protrude after light use, and I accidentally leaned on it, causing a deep bruise near my side. The outer material, while supposed to be rubberized, felt brittle and had visible damage near the threaded area of the cylinder. I attempted to adjust it, but the loosened pieces shifted again. The whole thing felt unstable and tippy, and at one point it nearly fell over while I was using it. The product's design is simply unsafe — it needs a total redesign. I filed an inquiry, but the process to get a replacement or even an exchange has been slow and frustrating. I still haven’t received a proper response despite labeling the situation as urgent. It’s hard to trust a product again after something like this. I was genuinely scared, and I wouldn’t recommend this to someone unless they want to risk injury.\"\n",

The liquid inside had an odd consistency, too thin to be stable, and the packaging gave no clear information about ingredients. I proceeded cautiously but within minutes of use a component snapped and the device began to topple. It barely missed hitting my buttock when it fell, which could have caused serious harm. I also noticed that it required some form of lubrication to operate smoothly, which was not mentioned anywhere. Breathing near the leaking material gave me a light-headed feeling and I honestly worried it could be toxic or poison-related. I contacted support and was told to discontinue use but received no follow-up or intervention. I am still feeling stressed about whether there will be any lingering effects. What is worse, it looks cosmetically intact so most people would not notice the fault until it is too late. This product should not be on the market. It is poorly made, poorly labeled, and potentially dangerous.\"\n",

One of the metal pieces was sharp enough to pierce the packaging, and another edge was so jagged it nearly caused a tear in my hand while unboxing. After setup, the unit seemed unstable and wobbled under normal use. It later ejected a small piece, narrowly missing my heel. I began to notice a strong fiberglass odor and immediately plugged it out of caution. The whole thing has left me feeling extremely stressed and even lethargic after dealing with the fallout. I have since tried to consult the company, but there has been no response and no offer of a refund despite the inconvenience and potential injury. I kept all proof and have submitted a formal complaint. This is not just a minor issue. Products like this should be reviewed by the FDA before being allowed on the market. I expected much better.\"\n",

One of the screws would not tighten properly and the unit began to drift out of position after a short time. While adjusting it, my hand brushed against a shard of exposed metal that left a deep welt. Later, I noticed the outer panel had melted slightly from regular use, and it emitted a strange smell like gassing plastic. A cable was so poorly attached that it came unscrewed when I tried to refuel the unit, and I had to use a screwdriver just to get it back in place. The company never responded to my messages and never notified me about any potential recalls. It is honestly hard to believe this item is legal to sell. I kept the receipt and filed a report, but the damage is done. If I had left this unattended for even a few more minutes, I truly believe it could have started a fire. I strongly urge others to stay away.\"\n",

We ended up in the hospital where an EMT had to assist with controlling the ooze from the injury. Upon inspection, the issue seemed to stem from faulty manufacturing — the wiring was exposed, and the internal parts were poorly assembled. The surface was sticky with some kind of gloppy resin, and the outer shell looked unevenly coated, possibly with cheap paint. It became obvious that this unit could not hold up to even basic use. It tipped forward easily and was hard to steer, even for someone experienced. I suspect this was not properly tested before being sent out. I’ve filed a report with the proper agency because this is not just a quality issue — it’s a safety hazard. If I had not acted quickly, the injury could have been much worse.

When I first opened the package, I noticed a strange residue — it looked like wax or some kind of molding compound — smeared over the plastic edges. The casing felt unstable and almost fell apart as I tried to assemble it. Shortly after plugging it in, the unit exploded with a loud pop, and I immediately unplugged it. A small piece of debris even hit my face, nearly scratching my cornea. I was left with an ache in my jaw and had to take an antihistamine for the swelling that followed. This is absolutely not acceptable. I checked the documentation and couldn’t find any proper SDS or warnings. It’s clear this item was either faultily manufactured or never inspected. I’m shocked something like this passed any kind of OSHA or quality standard. It’s outrageous that I paid this much for what turned out to be a serious safety risk.

A different part shattered after light pressure, sending particles across the room and nearly hitting my eye. I now have bloodshot vision in one eye and have had to schedule an exam at the clinic to rule out blindness. The material smells sour, and a swab showed some residue that I am unsure is even safe to touch. What’s worse is that there were no proper warnings, no safety documentation, and no indication of how dangerous this thing could be. My family is deeply shaken, and I’m overwhelmed just thinking about what could have happened. The negligence involved in letting this reach the market is unacceptable. I have filed a report and will never buy from this manufacturer again.\"\n",

My toddler was nearby and nearly choked on a small chunk that had broken off and rolled across the floor. We had to act fast to dislodge it from his throat, and it left us completely panicked. I never would have expected this from a supposedly family-safe item. The unpredictable design and complete lack of protection features make it incredibly shocking that this was cleared for sale. There were no proper guidelines, and the packaging included no mention of small parts or choking hazards. This should be reported to the appropriate bureau immediately. I am severely disappointed and urge others to keep this product far away from any household with children. The consequences could be fatal.\"\n",

After brief exposure, I developed an itchy dermatitis reaction that my pediatrician suspects may be linked to bronopol or another irritating agent not disclosed on the packaging. My child began vomiting shortly after touching the unit, and we had to rule out strep and other infections. What’s more concerning is the potential sensitization risk. The outer material left a sticky residue that triggered a biting sensation on the skin and slight lethargy after prolonged contact. We had to consult a surgeon because of ongoing cartilage pain, and the entire incident has been emotionally draining. The product should have come with proper warnings or at least a full Eurofins report to ensure safety.

I’m lucky it didn’t land in someone’s eye. The surface also had embedded dirt and felt sticky, as if the packaging had mastic residue left on it. I began to itch all over and had to see an ophthalmologist after my eye started reacting, possibly from inadvertent contact with whatever residue was on the device. There was no clear manual to help assess the risk, and honestly, the design poses more danger than any value. I don’t say this lightly, but the lethality without warnings or safeguards is disturbing.

I had to use an inhaler during the incident, and now I’m undergoing neurologic testing to assess whether the injury caused any lasting issues. I contacted customer care, and all they offered was an apology and no actual help. This is deplorable behavior for something that should have never left the warehouse in this condition.

Shortly after, I began to experience digestive discomfort and was eventually referred for a colonoscopy to rule out further complications. The doctor mentioned that contact with unknown chemicals can aggravate existing conditions. I tried to contact the company, but they offered no responsibility, only a vague statement about complying with safety standards.

We rushed to the doctor, who prescribed tablets and ordered a radiograph to ensure nothing had been swallowed. There was concern about possible mercury contamination from the material used, though it was never listed on the label. The reaction caused swelling that required follow-up with an orthopedic specialist. We were told the injury was mostly superficial, but there was a risk of long-term irritation.

Imaging showed irritation near the fibula, and they are assessing whether surgery or extraction may be needed if further complications occur. The device also had exposed wires and unglued parts, one of which left a bruise on her leg. This was clearly a defective product, poorly made with unsealed materials and slippery plastic. I contacted the manufacturer and was met with frustration and silence. I was even refused a refund. It is ridiculous that something this dangerous passed inspection.
