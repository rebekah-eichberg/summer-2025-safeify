This is the repository our Erdos Institute Summer 2025 Data Science Bootcamp Project.

## Overview of the project
The goal of the project is to predict bad, hazardous, and low-quality products, leaving the task of identifying best-sellers to future work. A main part of the
project has been to identify a way to label products as bad, low-quality, or hazardous. We addressed this challenge by leveraging the U.S. Consumer
Product Safety Commission (CPSC) database, using both recall and complaint reports to identify harmful products.

## Structure of the repository

### Modelling

### Data

### [Matching Amazon.com products with incident reports](matching/)
The ``matching`` folder contains notebooks and scripts used to match for matching Amazon product metadata to incident and recall reports for toys and childrenâ€™s products. The matching process combines fuzzy string matching, semantic similarity using transformer models, web search enrichment, and large language model (LLM) verification.
More information is contained in the [readme file](matching/) of this folder.

### [Cleaning and feature engineering](cleaning_and_feature_engineering/)
The `cleaning_and_feature_engineering` directory contains notebooks and scripts for cleaning Amazon product metadata and review data, engineering features, and builds the main dataset for modeling. Please see the [readme file](cleaning_and_feature_engineering/) for more information.
