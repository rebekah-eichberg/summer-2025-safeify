"LJN Sling 'Em-Fling 'Em Wrestling Ring Toy Recalled",11/4/1991 ,"November 4, 1991 Release # 92-015 WASHINGTON, D.C. -- LJN Toys, Ltd., New York, NY, in cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), recalled its World Wrestling Federation Sling 'Em- Fling 'Em wrestling ring toy because of potentially severe injuries should a child fall on one of the corner posts of the wrestling ring. LJN was a subsidiary of MCA, Inc. during the period of manufacture and sale of the wrestling ring. LJN, a publisher, marketer and distributor of home entertainment products, is no longer in the toy business. The Commission indicates that there were four very serious injuries which resulted when children, ranging in age from six to 10 years, fell onto one of these toys. In each case, one of the four rigid plastic corner posts penetrated the child's body cavity causing severe internal injury. LJN sold about 1.4 million toy wrestling rings between 1985 and 1989 for a retail price up to $20. The toy was promoted by featuring action figures of World Wrestling Federation (WWF) stars such as Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant. The figures were sold separately. The ring has an 18-1/2 inch square plastic base that is 3-1/2 inches high with four 9-1/2 inch long rigid blue plastic posts that snap into place at each corner. Once in place, the posts are about six inches high. Red, white, and blue elastic bands form the ropes around the ring. A decal with the WWF logo was supplied with each toy. Consumers may identify the LJN wrestling ring by looking underneath the base for these words molded into the plastic: 1985 LJN TOYS LTD. TITAN SPORTS INC. MADE IN U.S.A. To prevent additional injuries, consumers who own these wrestling ring toys are urged to remove the four rigid plastic posts immediately. Because the posts are so rigidly secured, consumers may have to break the posts to remove them. LJN Toys Ltd. is out of business and cannot be contacted.The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is announcing this recall as part of its mission to protect the public from unreasonable risks of injury and death associated with consumer products. The CPSC is the Federal agency responsible for consumer product safety. Some 15,000 different types of consumer products fall within the Commission's jurisdiction and each year these products are involved in an estimated 28.5 million injuries and 21,600 deaths",92015,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1992/LJN-Sling-Em-Fling-Em-Wrestling-Ring-Toy-Recalled

This recall applies only to gyms with plastic or unstitched fabric straps. Gyms having fabric straps that are stitched in two locations are not being recalled. The freestanding activity center for infants, gym no. 8722, has four tubular-shaped supports and a crossbar with three fabric or plastic straps suspended from the crossbar. Each strap holds a toy, namely Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck and a disc-shaped baby rattle with a mirror on one side. The baby gym sold nationally for about $17.00 in 1987. Illco and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said some parents have complained about buckles coming off unstitched fabric straps on gym sets. CPSC tests have shown that buckles may also come loose from plastic straps. The buckles and loops of the gym are small enough to be ingested by an infant. In addition, the mirrored rattle may break into small parts and may present a potential choking hazard if it comes off the strap. Consumers having a gym set with plastic or unstitched fabric straps holding the figures and rattle to the crossbar should immediately take the toys away from infants and toddlers and request replacement straps, buckles, and rattles by writing to the Consumer Service Department, Illco Toy Company, 200 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10010",88098,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/1988/Toy-Firm-Recalls-Disney-Baby-Play-Gyms

Babies sit inside the playring, which is used as an activity center and looks like a pool float.

CPSC is aware of infant suffocation deaths when their airflow is restricted from contact with soft surfaces. The recalled playring, which measures 40 inches in diameter, has a yellow, plastic, inflatable, inner tube with a multicolor cloth covering. The cloth covering features eight activities for babies, including a boat rattle, a mirror flower, a soft teether on a puppy's collar, a butterfly, and a squeak ball and fish. A tag on the bottom of the cloth covering reads Warning! and Recommended for children 6 to 18 months. The packaging reads, Discovery Playring, MADE IN CHINA and Not to be used in water. They are sold with plastic foot pumps for inflating the playrings. Walmart stores, and One Step Ahead, a mail-order company, sold the playrings from July 1998 though April 2000 for between $20 and $35.
