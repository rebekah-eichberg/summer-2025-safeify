Such a waste.\n\nI don't understand why they can't make these DM Screens more useful for these \"kinds of adventures\" rather than solely the specific adventure.  You're supposed to be able to transpose this adventure to other lands outside the Forgotten Realms.  So even just a list of new monsters or NPCs would at least be useful than the map.  Even more would just be stuff related to running the game but broad-use stuff related to giants.\n\nSame thing with Curse of Strahd.  Why not make it useful for raven loft, undead or horror campaigns in general... instead a huge amount of screen space is solely mapping out Castle Ravenloft, which is only useful during a small fraction of the time even for the Curse of Strahd adventure, let alone various other Ravenloft adventuring.\n\nThey really kill the extended use of these screens by not thinking about their potential use, both for the adventure in question, as well as use in a broader sense.\n\nThe Rage of Demons screen is far more useful for broad under dark adventuring - covering a lot of rules for the various conditions you may suffer... and the map is only one panel.\n\nThis Storm Giants one is decent for a few tables it includes - but really misses the mark.

         "My review will mirror others in that this kind of misses the mark and there are some lost opportunities to help DM's.  I wouldn't advise new DM's to use this by itself.  They should stick to the generic 5e DM screen and just copy/print the other useful information for SKT.\nI do like that the information they did put in the screen was relevant to the game and makes accessible some of the frequently visited tables from the adventure book.  I also like the map from the perspective that it contains the page references to the cities and locations. This is pretty useful, especially during Ch 3 of the adventure.\nHowever, there is a very Large amount of wasted space that could easily have been utilized instead of having the whole map take up 2 panels of the screen. The middle of the ocean could have contained info on the Giant hierarchy, the Giant Rune symbols, the Random encounters at Sea table from the DMG, trap tables, or any number of other usefully applicable information to the story.  I would have done away with the Sea portion of the map completely and used that space more efficiently.  In all actuality, the entire map could have been an extra insert, freeing up far more space and making this product far more appealing...or the Adventure book could have included it as a tear out.  There should have been better collaboration on this product.\nOn a different note, the printing on my copy of the screen was not sized correctly.  The Left and right creases are right over the edge of the words...especially on the Right side.  It is almost illegible when the screen is up and in it's general position at the gaming table.(See attached pic)\n\nI can understand the idea and desire to produce tailored DM Screens for these adventure books, but I don't feel they've truly taken the time to get feedback on their ideas from enough sources before printing. It's coming across as licensed money grab instead of a Value Add product to the adventure line.",

         "Pretty good book with a variety of unique card sleights (palming, manipulating cards in the deck, etc.). These sleights are the 'real work', so it will take a little perseverance. Many of these utility sleights are ones that you ought to know if you want to be a card sleight-of-hand worker.\nThe instructions are generally clear, but sometimes a detail here and there gets a little confusing. There's a fair number of photos showing how to do many of the sleights.\nSometimes a sleight is a little more complicated than it needs to be. My recommendation is to follow the author's steps in slow-motion with a deck of cards in hand. After you are familiar with the overall effect, you can make adjustments based on what your comfortable with. There may also be other newer methods for learning these sleights if you want to invest in newer card sleight instruction (such as the Daryl Encyclopedia of Card Sleights videos, etc.).\nRight now, I'm working on the side steal sleight. He gives a T. Nelson Downs version which has some merit, but it is much more complicated than necessary. The author's own version is a little more do-able. But even the author's method becomes a little too fidgety, so I've made minor modifications to make it work well for me. I start in slow-motion, counting through the substeps to keep pace while I do the move (1..2..3..4). Then I repeat it until I can bring it up to full speed.\nIf you want to learn sleights for cheap, try this book. You may have to pick and choose through the sleights, and there may be better methods to perform some of these sleights now, but it's not bad for under $10.",

         "When I unexpectedly came across a picture of Buckley on the first page of the book, and after hearing the other reviews of how difficult and advanced the techniques in the book were, I couldn't believe my eyes. I was surprised to see the face of a handsome teenager, of which my previous impression was COMPLETELY the opposite to the one I held in my hands. And this guy was a professional card magician at the age of 18, and able to do tricks infront of hundreds of people on-stage in 1908!\nI have a feeling that this guy's mystery and skill probably gained him significant success with girls his age. The mysterious effects of these difficult to execute sleights are priceless and dazzling beyond belief. If a 3 columns card trick can make girls believe in magic.. then Buckley's stuff probably knocked their socks off... literally! Believe me, this guy would be able to blow David Blaine out of the water and make him look like Bob Longe.\nThat being said and out of the way, the book itself is amazing. There are very clearcut photos of Buckley's hands and very impressive card tricks, or as he calls them in the fourth section, \"Card Experiments\". Best of all, this book isn't like most others where the authors seem to purposely be vague (S.W. Erdnase) and not give the best descriptions. Mr. Buckley gives you every detail and is your friend throughout the book, showing you exactly how everything is done without any confusion.\nAnd there is SO much different good stuff in here, that you'll probably never need another book for advanced materials.\nIt is a great book and a great reference to help you on your way to card excellence and showmanship. You will not be disappointed with this purchase.",

When I saw that a plush Rocket dog was being released I knew we just had to get one. Boy was I surprised when this arrived in the mail. Instead of being a soft cuddly toy for my little boy I received a dog with stiff, crusty, PAINTED ON, black spots! Only the very surface of the spots are black, and there are even some marks where the paint was smeared!!! The fur on the tail looks like in was dipped in paint and is as stiff as a board. I've never seen anything like it! Hopefully there are some of these being made that actually have soft black fur spots like a normal stuffed animal rather than globs of black paint as spots, but I couldn't help but share my experience so that others might be aware."

If you like games with those values, it is a good game.  I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.  The rules are VERY well crafted, there were no \"rule says this, no it doesn't\" fights.  For as many as there are, they were straight forward and easy to understand.  But good mechanics do not change the tedious nature of the game play.  We spent 6 hours playing the 30 rounds of the game, and I left before the PVP section started.\n\nOne thing that really needs to change is the way the blue monsters are handled.  Only quests give you anything and blue monsters aren't associated with quests, so everyone avoids them and they become pointless roadblocks everywhere.\n\nFor the price, the minis should have been painted.  They are well sculpted but many were badly molded and trimmed.  The Wizards minis are farm better quality.\n\nThis game is made by the same company that did Arkham Horror, and they are rather similar.  WOW has better rules, but Arkham Horror is far more fun (subjectively speaking, that one still takes forever too but I enjoy it much more)."
