I have two boys- 3yrs & 1yr- They have actually read our book so much it fell apart.  I am purchasing  another copy.  They LOVE this book.  A great gift idea for baby showers--  how wonderful it is when your child curls up in your lap to have storytime.  This is a book they will get first everytime.  This book is amazing there  are few words and numerous things to discuss.  It is simply A MUST!\n",

I bought it for my 4 year old and he can do it, but you have to have everything lined up PERFECTLY and then it still won't work a lot of times. you have to concentrate so hard on the pen you barely can concentrate on the story or images. the books might be find for reading but just not worth it to me\n",

We did hold back the guns and the cutlasses because we felt uncomfortable giving these to our toddler. But overall a great afternoon's adventure and a ton of fun! A side benefit, it keeps the birds from hitting our windows during migration time. Soy-based inks. Crocodile great is awesome.\n",

The 63 piece is perfect but she normally doesn't like puzzles that are not pictures of something \"real\"...she doesn't like cartoons, etc.  These are just great.  I have gotten 2 and will buy more....  The container  they come in is also wonderful and easy to keep up with.  M.Stout\n",

The pieces are sturdy, with little puzzle dust, and have varied shapes without being too crazy (wink). Before receiving the puzzle, I wasn't aware that there are two secret owls lurking in the background as well!\n",

I found myself really getting into the game ordering my troops around and cussing at the enemy when I lost. It is a great game for anyone who loves RISK or the axis and allies series. This is a game that takes a long time to play, took us about 3 hours to complete, so I recommend playing on a table and not on the floor.\n",
