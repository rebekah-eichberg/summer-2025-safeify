"Lite Machines Recall of Motor Speed Controller",12/31/2001 ,"Lite Machines Recall of Motor Speed Controller Recall Alert U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission Office of Information and Public Affairs Washington, DC 20207 December 31, 2001 Alert #02-514 CPSC, Lite Machines Corp. Announces Recall of Motor Speed Controller PRODUCT: Motor Speed Controllers - Lite Machines Corporation of West Lafayette, Ind., is voluntarily recalling 375 Fusion 35 electric-motor speed controllers that it shipped with its Corona electric helicopter kits before December 2001. The Fusion 35 speed controller, a small printed circuit board with wires extending from either side, is packed in a clear plastic bag separate from other radio system components, and carries the identification Fusion 35 #30499 on its front plate. These components were sold with the electric helicopter kits at hobby shops from November 2001 through December 2001 for about $60. PROBLEM: The Fusion 35 motor speed controller may not operate properly due to a weakness in a batch of integrated circuit (IC) chips. The (IC) chip can become hot and damage the controller. In certain instances, a malfunctioning IC chip can cause the helicopter motor to turn on for the several seconds before the power is disconnected which can damage the helicopter or cause injury to the operator or bystanders. INCIDENTS/INJURIES: There were three incidents where the motor came on for several seconds and damaged the helicopter. There have been no injuries. WHAT TO DO: Consumers should send the Fusion 35 speed controller to Lite Machines for a diagnostic test by the manufacturer. If the unit is defective it will be replaced free of charge. For more information, contact Lite Machines at (765) 463-0959 between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. CT Monday through Friday.",02514,https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2002/CPSC-Lite-Machines-Corp-Announces-Recall-of-Motor-Speed-Controller-
