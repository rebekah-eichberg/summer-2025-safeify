To encourage immediate response, this program will expire on March 1, 1979.

Mattel and the Consumer Product Safety Commission stated that the Mail-In program was initiated to remove the possibility of an accident and to inform parents of the need to caution children regarding small objects of any type which might be put in the mouth. At the same time, the offer of a free Hot Wheels miniature car is intended to compensate for any loss of play value due to return of the missiles.
