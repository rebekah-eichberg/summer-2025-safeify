Should they change their mind we would very much like the chance to review the product, and would be happy to provide a good will exchange of product to them for their help to get us the product to review. We would like to ensure the product was as intended by design and product process controls.   This product line has been a popular line.  Since it was introduced in 2010, the line has sold over 8,750,000 units.  There have been a couple of versions of the product that used the crank mechanism to help a child form the dough into shapes.  These versions with the crank mechanism have sold almost 3 million units into the market.  The years of 2010 and 2011 were the popular years for the product line.  We have a call center, and the contact information to reach us is on the box and in the instructions, and we have an online site as well.  Since 2010 and the product’s introduction we have had less than a 0.05% contacts rate on the units sold. Since the product introduction in 2010, there has been only 1 prior contact about any type of similar incident on the crank mechanism.  There was no medical attention needed, and only minor home attention was used to resolve the incident. The child was okay without any follow up attention.  This is a 0.000034% call rate, based on the prior incident, and in that case the parent merely notified us of the case so we were aware.  I have provided to the CPSC online system 38 lab testing reports specific to this version product, for the USA mechanical, physical and chemical safety standards and requirements.  We use qualified, and registered with CPSC, third party labs that specialize in toy testing.  We have passed all the ASTM F 963 and CPSIA tests.  In addition to the USA requirement passing reports, we have passed all European and Canadian testing requirements.  Using Design Hazard Review to anticipate play patterns and potential concerns, we designed the crank mechanism intentionally to NOT catch or lock in place to prevent potential pinch injuries.  There is no electrical or other motor, so the user decides the speed and power used to drive the mechanism that is forming the dough shapes. This is specifically designed this way so that a child cranking the unit could NOT pinch a finger and jam the mechanism catching skin in place.  All edges are beveled and smoothed.  This is routinely monitored in the production process. We would have liked the opportunity to get the incident product unit back, to determine possible root causes of this incident.  We take reports of concern on our product very seriously.  In this case, the parent has chosen not to contact us directly.  At this time, based on the number of units on the market, our call center contacts, independent testing assessment and reports, as well as our own production controls and auditing, we believe the product is appropriate for use and meets or exceeds all applicable safety requirements.   We are always saddened to hear of a poor experience with a toy.  And we would be happy to exchange this product or help this customer should they contact us. Thank you",,

This was actually the third time that this happened with this toy, which is why I felt prompted to write you today.  The first time, I chalked it up to an uncoordinated child who was riding the toy, the second time I thought it was just a coincidence.  The third time, I decided to write, as this is just a terrible toy. This is a poorly designed toy in which the balance is off.  The front of the toy tips forward very easily, with the slightest movement when it is in the ride-on position.  (The toy is marketed as having three positions for play). It is obvious to me now that it is very easy for a child to pitch forward and smash their face on the ground, in addition to being unassisted by their hands to break the fall, since they are holding onto the handles of it.  As an adult handling the toy and manipulating it in this manner, it becomes apparent that it is a design flaw, as it happens so easily with minimal effort. In two previous separate incidents (not reported prior to this), two visiting children had pretty bad forward-tipping accidents on this toy.  In one of those incidents, the child tipped forward while riding on the toy and hit her chin, while her teeth penetrated her bottom lip, sustaining a rather nasty bloody laceration from the impact.  We were grateful that it happened in the house on the wood floor and not outside on the concrete or asphalt. (Yikes!) The incidence that just occurred this week (7/5/11) was a close call with my own child.  She was just sitting there, hardly even moving on the toy, and I was sitting on the ground nearby playing with my older child.  Suddenly, as she stretched her feet out forward on the wheels of the toy, the toy pitched forward and I caught my daughter by her face just in time before she and the toy hit the ground.  The toy is now out of reach, as we have determined it to be an unsafe toy that causes injury.",,,92084,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Level of care not known,Female,My Child,1.0,Yes,No,,,No,No,No,," Radio Flyer takes product safety issues very seriously.

Kiddieland has promptly addressed the issue by adding a warning label on the smokestack that alerts adults to the possibility of a stuck arm so it can be avoided with proper adult supervision, as is the case with all toys.  The warning goes a little further in the event that a child's hand or arm gets stuck anyway and offers a simple method to dislodge same by pouring a small amount of warm water and mild soap, such as dish washing liquid, into the space.

There was only an email address to follow up and after 3 days of waiting there has been no response, so this will attempt to address the few facts already known.  First, the item in question has been rigorously tested multiple times by the factory, Intertek and Walmart, where it is distributed.  It has passed every line item for children 12-36 months, which leads to the other known fact that the child using it was only 8 months old.

PA-9776 (HK),K-Mart,,12/25/2013 ,No,"To Whom It May Concern, Hello, my name is [REDACTED]; we have a set of 22-month twins that are identical girls.  They weigh 21 and 20.8 pounds respectively.  Yesterday, we witnessed that our daughter flipped over forward, while riding on our singing pink little riding pony [Rock n' Roll Pals (048181?), without wheels], manufactured by Kiddleland Toys Ltd.  When she flipped over the pony, she hit her head on the corner of a table that was three feet away, causing us to worry if there might be any permanent damage.  We have currently removed the toys.  The toy indicates that it is age-appropriate for 12-36 months, which in this case we were not negligent.  They are also very mild mannered little ladies.I presume that the Rockers do not have enough support forward or back ward, because I simply tried dropping the Rocker Pony down straight from under three feet on the carpet, and the result is that the arch of the rocker forces the rocker go forward because of the weight of the head of the pony and causes the flip.  In these incidents, the rider adds additional weight, making the pony top-heavy, thus causing the flip forward with the momentum and the lack of extended support.We recommend that a review and quality control check on this toy be done accordingly.  Furthermore, this toy ought to be recalled due to the design with the lack of support.  We are filing a report with the US Consumer Product Safety commission, and will be filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau BBB, if this situation is not rectified.Thank you &Very Respectfully, [REDACTED]",Honolulu,Hawaii,96818,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Seen by Medical Professional,Female,My Child,1.0,,,,,,Yes,,Toy ought to be recalled due to the design with the lack of support.," Kiddieland refutes the alleged complaint on the basis of several facts.  First, the test performed by the complaintant, while well intended, is too elementary on its own merits to be valid in any way.  Simple dropping any toy to determine whether it is weight biased and then extrapolating that the childs weight magnifies the problem proves nothing, whereas extensive safety tests performed by Kiddieland in accord with all established requlations over a ten year period is actually meaningful.  Furthermore, no child should be using a rocking toy when sharp objects are in the vicinity, so the question of adult supervision, clearly marked on the package, comes into play.  Finally, the safety record of Kiddieland rockers, when used according to sensible guidelines, is completely untarnished.  Kiddieland hopes to be able to discuss all this with the complaintant in the near future.",,

It seemed fitting. I didn't know there was even a recall on it and now i feel so so so horrible as a parent. How was i supposed to know or to think about checking the products against recalls- especially one that i had just bought! So we were at a family camping trip and there's 11 of us there. It's our 4th day (out of 6) and my parents are fishing off the dock while my daughter is riding my nephew in the hot wheel. I was sitting on the cabins screened in porch and i see my daughter getting too close to the dock and remind her that the alligators will eat her. There's really one in there and if course i doubt want her playing near the water when I'm not there to watch her. Well as they keep getting closer to the water my daughter started screaming that it's broke. I see her stand up some and the camper is still riding and she started screaming about not wanting the alligator to eat them. I run outside and before i can reach her the hot wheel hits the water and there's no real shallow part to the lake so I'm screaming and panicking cause i know my nephew can't swim and there really is an alligator in the water- I've saw him before. Add i am still running to them i see my dad drop his fishing pole and jump in the lake right after the kids hit the water. The water goes to his waist which isn't that deep for an adult but it is to a child. Anyhow he grabs my nephew up and throws him toward the grass and me as i run up and then he grabs my daughter and walks out with her and tells me to never buy another da*n hot wheel again! It seemed like an incident that took forever but it felt like i was seeing it in slow motion. It all really happened pretty quickly. I had to console my daughter and she was scared and shaking because id the alligator. So i feel so horrible about using that constantly as a warning reason but how was i to know the camper would malfunction??!! My dad lost his good fishing pole to the lake and of course the camper drowned and was seriously too heavy for me to fish out of the water. I actually didn't see the point as i didn't think it'd be recalled. So now i have a distraught daughter, a mad father, a mother who keeps reminding me that it's my fault and i could've killed the 2 kids,  and a nephew that said he had fun. I just saw that it was recalled and now i feel 100% relieved because i can show my parents that it wasn't me to blame but the toy maker. I can't get back my dad's good/lucky fishing pole, the $398+tax i spent on my daughter's camper that she got for Christmas,  or the time spent consoling my daughter or the time lost while my parents yelled at me- and im an adult btw. Smh. Anyhow i do know that the FRC29 was the sane exact number on my daughter's camper because i originally wrote all the numbers down in case it was stolen from our home- then id have the serial numbers to prove it was mine if they found it or located It at a thrift store or whatever. So i know it's the right number. I don't know the color of the petal tho, but i can assume with the numbers being the same and the incident at hand- that it was the same gray one. My daughter now wakes up screaming from nightmares about drowning and alligators. I am taking her to a therapist who says she PTSD from the traumatic incident. It seems crazy and unreal- but then again, my life feels like a movie-a not well written movie tho. Lol.Thank your and sorry my story was so long. Thank you for giving me the relief that it wasn't my fault- rather it was yours. So what happens next? Btw- very glad for life and no injuries. Also the exact location was at [REDACTED] and they don't have direct address for it.- just the longitude and latitude. But I can tell toy about the location.

It appeared to me that at least three items resulted in her forward ejection from the toy, namely her travel speed, her seating position/high center of gravity on the seat which appeared to be even with or slightly above the hand wheel and the small 2  diameter caster wheels that could not easily roll over a tapered wooden threshold/transition strip between two rooms. In my judgment it was at least these three factors that resulted in a sudden stop to the toy as it hit the tapered threshold and pitched my granddaughter forward, over the hand-wheel and on the floor!I did review you safety precautions for using the YBIKE on line and noted that you specify using the toy on a smooth flat surface along with protective clothing for the child including a safety helmet.  However there was no precaution regarding the situation we encountered when operating the toy between rooms over a tapered threshold strip.I would also recommend that you post a visible label on the toy noting that a safety helmet must be worn when operating the YBIKE!

At one year of age we seated him on the rocker, gently moving him back and forth.  He loved  it!  At 14 months he was able to climb on the rocker and rock himself.  Although this rocker is indeed the cutest, I do not consider it safe for the ages it is intended-one to three years.  With his Dad sitting next to the rocker on the floor and both his Grandparents nearby, we urged him to rock. As he rocked a bit more all on his own power, suddenly the rocker flipped over backwards, with my Grandson hitting the floor with his head and the rocker on top of him.  He was screaming.  He did have a bump on his head--thank goodness, the floor was carpeted, he just missed the marble fireplace hearth.  It does not seem that a toy made for a one to three year old should have this issue--especially with a child at the low end of the age requirement.  My son was right there, but, never thought that his son was in danger, he reached out to grab the baby as the rocker flipped, but,  not soon enough to prevent the injury.  Afterwards as we examined the rocked, it seems that the arc is inadequate.  Or, as my husband suggested, that a wooden stop should have been a part of the rocker to keep it from overturning.  I need to add that our baby is under 25 lbs.  We continue to let the baby ride his horse, but, now have a hand at all times on the rump of the toy, to prevent this from ever happening again.

We have printed multiple warnings on the tags and on the bag the rocker is shipped in that clearly explains that the rocker can and will tip over when rocked aggressively. We have tested these rails and they will not tip over during normal use. It still takes aggressive rocking and the weight shifted into the rocking direction to tip it over, but just like almost any riding toy, it will tip over.",,

This was a criotical step in the evaluation process because the reported incident is - to the best of our knowledge - a unique event that has not happened before or since.  It is unfortunate that no one actrually witnessed how the arm broke off, however.  This is not something that is easily duplicated and, of course, the item passes all tests without fail.  Nevertheless, Kiddieland is taking immediate action on all furure production to strengthen/reinfoce the arm so nothing short of a baseball bat would be able to fracture it.  The mother who reported this is being sent a replacement toy at no charge immediately and we are enclosing a pre-paid postal box so that she can send the fractured arm back to us for evaluation, and she is also emailing images of the toy.  It is our initial impression that the arm was probably damaged while in transit from our factory to the USA and/or at store level prior to sale.  A hairline crack could go unnoticed until the unit was used, of course, but the chances of this happening again are remote, at best.  ",,

The consumer states the toy has purple plastic restraints which snap in the front that were closed while her daughter was sitting on the toy. After approximately 5 minutes the consumer saw her daughter fall on the ground.  The consumer noticed the purple restraints were open. She picked up her daughter from the ground. The consumer states her daughter was crying loud. She noticed a bruise on her daughter's left shoulder and had scrapes on her face. The incident occurred outside of the consumer's home where she lived at the time.An hour after the incident occurred the consumer tried to pick up her daughter by grabbing her daughter's arms and her daughter immediately started crying. The consumer checked her daughter's left arm and noticed the bruise on her shoulder looked worse. The consumer states it looked like a bone was popping out. The consumer took her daughter to the ER at Methodist Hospital [REDACTED] located in [REDACTED]. A doctor took X-rays of the shoulder and advised the consumer that her daughter's collar bone broke in half. The doctor wrapped the child's left shoulder and put the child's arm in a sling. The doctor prescribed the child pain medication. The child was released the same day. The consumer does not recall the doctor's name who examined her daughter.The consumer contacted her daughter's physician and the physician recommended the child to go to a specialist, Dr.[REDACTED]. Dr. [REDACTED] examined the child's shoulder and advised the consumer her daughter's collar bone was broken in half. Dr.[REDACTED] put a cast on the child's shoulder.The consumer's daughter wore the cast for approximately 6 weeks. Approximately a week after the incident the consumer contacted the retail store where she purchased the toy and advised them of the incident. The retail store provided the consumer with the manufacturer's contact information. The consumer states the manufacturer is located in Hong Kong, China.The consumer was contacted by [REDACTED], a representative from Liberty Mutual. The consumer believes the insurance company is representing the distrubutor. The consumer was informed by [REDACTED] that the manufacturer does not have a legal representative. The consumer states she has not contacted the manufacturer since they are located in China. The consumer hired an attorney from [REDACTED] Law Firm to represent her in the legal suit and be the point of contact regarding this incident. The consumer did not have the attorney's information but indicated the law firm is located in [REDACTED].

This was first brought to our attention in April of 2013, BTW, and we are as puzzled now as we were then to ascertain exactly what might have happened.  All of our toys are rigorously tested repeatedly and there have been no other reports of this type brought to our attention.  In point of fact, the safety rail described has a firm locking device when properly snapped into place by an adult, and a child cannot unsecure it, so it seems that the lock may not have been fully engaged at the time.  Beyond that, the distance a child could fall off the ride on is quite short and it is difficult to comprehend how such an injury could have actually taken place unless there were mitigating circumstances or misuse.  In short, Kiddieland is so very sorry that this child was injured, but the circumstances are suspect, at best. ",,

That said, the purchase was made in December of 2018 and the incident happened in January of 2019, but the report to CPSC was only made one full year later, which is difficult to understand.  Also curious is the claim it was the battery that had ruptured and I note that Kiddieland does not manufacture same.  Finally, the area where this took place was in Arizona where temperatures often exceed 100 degrees, so it would be nice to know exactly where the toy was stored and for how long.

However, 2 days ago, my friend's son rode on it sitting backward. The car lost its balance and tipped backward. Even though the dad was staying next to this son, the 20 month old baby fell with the car hitting his face on the ground cutting his lower lip open and caused severe nose bleeding.

We have endeavored to speak to the individual that reported the incident and have not yet been able to connect, but will continue trying, of course.  At the heart of the issue is the plain fact that the toy was misused, and more than once, with little or no apparent adult supervision or guidance.  No ride on toy is designed to be ridden backwards the way in which this one was - and more that once with the same unfortunate results each time, per the report.  This is the reason all manufacturers clearly state Adult Supervision Required on their packages, including Kiddieland.  This particular product has been successfully tested over and over again for normal and reasonable use, but that use does not include riding backwards or standing on it or anything of the sort.",,

We purchased this in Jan/February of 2025 for roughly $400. My children have since been riding it - last week I noticed my kids were hitting things at full speed and then crying and incredibly scared, clearly an accident. My children do not hit things with their ride on toys and never have up until this point - which we found to be very odd. My husband checked the entire toy over to ensure there was no possible corrosion or mud stuck under the pedal - which there was not. Fast forward to this past Sunday around 11am - we were all out enjoying our backyard and the spring weather. My kids were driving the four wheeler when all of the sudden it goes barreling down the hill and doesn't stop. It hits our trampoline at max speed and the tires continue rolling and the four wheeler does not stop, even after hitting the trampoline. My 4 year old son was driving it and was crushed and his throat and the trampoline medal were touching, keep in mind the four wheeler's tires were still spinning and it was still trying to go. It would NOT STOP! We got our son out of the four wheeler and it was still running, almost like the gas was being pressed, except there was nobody on it or near it. This could have resulted in my son breaking his neck or worse - getting decapitated. This is all due to a gas pedal that is FAULTY. This could have KILLED MY INNOCENT TODDLER. This was supposed to be a safe toddler toy. Instead it could have killed him!As you can see in the attached images, the roll cage bar that is there for PROTECTION couldn't even protect him in an event like this as it broke into literal pieces! The four wheeler kept accelerating and wouldn't stop after it hit the trampoline and continued breaking pieces off it.This toy is going straight to the DUMP! As should all of the other ones located on store shelves. This is absolutely absurd! This should not have happened to a child. It should have been looked over a million times for safety before being sold for consumer purchase. AND, should come with some sort of braking system!To include, the age range specifically states 3-8 years old - this is untrue! This toy should NOT be utilized until AT LEAST 5 or 6 years old due to how fast it goes - although it says it only goes 5 MPH, I highly doubt.",wichita falls,Texas,76306,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Male,My Child,3.0,Yes,No,,,,Yes,,,BRC TOYS LLC: We are committed to designing and manufacturing products that are safe and fun to ride.

When I won the item from auction online, I knew it was missing a wheel and a wing on the toy and was going to get it fixed for my son to play with it.  While I was searching for replacement parts, I saw on https://www.cpsc.gov/Recalls/2015/larose-industries-recalls-peanuts-flying-ace-ride-on-toys that the toy was recalled back in 2015 and I could do nothing with the toy except destroy it.  I brought this to the auction houses attention and they did not want to take the item back, and I am worried they are selling more items that have been recalled.  If the item wasnt in as bad of shape, I would have not thought about it and not known that it was recalled and my son could have been injured (he is 2 yrs of age at this time, so alot of items still go in his mouth.)  He could have also been hurt by the item itself by the wing being broken off or the wheel missing.  I am highly upset.  I was hoping something could be done about the lack of effort on their end, so I started looking to see if it were even legal for them to sell this item to me.

Going on in 2069, the law states that a fine of up to $100,000 could be assessed per item up to $15million, per day (if I read this correctly.)  I know they sold this item to me, I can provide any receipts or pictures as you desire, and can only think of how many more items they sell that fall into this category. This is only one of many locations this business has and Im sure there are many other illegal items being sold. Its very upsetting and I would like something to be done about it.

After extinguishing the fire, crews noted a large melted puddle of plastic with what appeared to be a battery and electrical wires in the center of the garage floor. There was little else involved in the fire. A security system picture revealed the location had been occupied by a battery operated riding child's toy.

Luckily she was able to get this out of his throat and he was saved.  He was very close to not making it.  It was the scariest moment of our lives.  Basically, the distributor (Moderno Kids) says that it is not their problem because they are not the manufacturer.  However, the manufacturer is in China.  Moderno Kids sells many different products from the same manufacturer.  Additionally, they say that the following:[Redacted], all tapes as well as all packing materials and plastic bags should be removed prior to giving any toy to a child. This toy has ASTM F963 certification that confirms its compliance with all toy safety standards. We will definitely address this with manufacturer, but dont forget that all little kids require constant supervision because they are unpredictable in many ways.Here is why this is wrong... This is not about lack of supervision.  My wife was there with him and this is why he is alive.  This is not about following instructions.  We did this. We removed everything that was evident.  This sticker (and there is more than one that is small like this) is transparent with nothing on it at all.  They could easily create a larger sticker, change the color, use large foam instead of the sticker, clearly state all items that need to be removed, etc. However, they choose to cut corners and this is bound to cost a child a life.

There is a heart shape compartment on the front inside of the handlebars at chest height.  This compartment opens from the bottom and lifts upwards.  The battery case is in this area and it can also be used to carry toys.  The lid can get stuck in the up position and it is easy for a toy to become lodged in  the  compartment and the  lid will not close. On Thursday Oct 13th, my daughter and I were alarmed to see that [redacted] was riding around with this lid stuck opened and the sharp pointed end of the heart aimed directly at her chest.  If she were to stop suddenly, such as hitting a curb or other object she could be thrown forward and impaled in the chest by the sharp point.  I feel this could be the cause of a very serious injury and perhaps even death if they were to hit that point at great force.I called Huffy Corporation this morning and talked to them about my concerns. The lady said she could send me a lid to the compartment if I wanted to replace it.  I told her that even with a new lid it could still be kept opened if a big toy was put into it and the danger would still be there.  Her only comment then was I will pass this along to our safety people.  I would have figured that since this item poses a large possibility of injury they would have reacted with more urgency over seeing that I, as a concerned consumer and grandmother was worried enough to report it.  She didn't even ask for my name or any contact information.

Only to say she would pass the information along to their safety department.  Did not take my name or any contact information.," Consumer safety and product quality are extremely important to Huffy Corporation. We thank the consumer for taking the time to communicate her concerns about this product. Shortly after Consumer Service received the call, it notified the quality department which initiated a product review. The compartment cover pivots at the top. The natural inclination, due to gravity, is for the cover to close. The bottom of the plastic molded heart is not sharp, nor does it have a sharp edge. By all standard definitions it is not a projection. The product was tested to and meets ASTM F963, Standard Consumer Safety Specification for Toy Safety and ANSI Tricycle Standard.In response to the consumer call, Huffy Corporation will reinforce the Consumer Service requirement to obtain contact information for all consumer calls expressing concerns about a product. Huffy Corporation will continue to evaluate current and future products for real and perceived hazards and eliminate them where possible.Huffy Corporation encourages all individuals to contact the company whenever there is a concern about a product's safety.

There is a Ford decal on the inside of the pedal car The pedal car is manufactured in China. I thought that some areas of the sheet metal construction were not properly formed resulting in what I considered excessively sharp edges. I did the assembly on the toy per the enclosed instructions, and while checking it over, I noticed that the sheet metal side body panels where they meet the dash area, are not crimped over like the balance of the sheet metal, which results, I feel, in excessively sharp and hazardous edges.  How sharp?  Well, while not the most scientific method in the world, I took a fresh carrot the size of an adult finger, and gently pushed it against the right side poorly crimped area and that edge sliced that carrot like a knife would. Imaging what would happen if a child slipped and their hand or face happened to hit that edge. The pedal car is made in China according to seller.  I have been in discussion with [REDACTED] at the Sellers company, and he has been somewhat helpful with regards to a partial refund on my payment.  However, regardless of any refund, the inherent danger of the sheet metal remains, and I thought you and your office may want to probe this further. II am enclosing pics.

On Saturday he was riding it and drove it through a barb wire fence and cut his neck very bad.  It was 4cm laceration that cut completely though his skin.  I was watching my son, I just couldn't get there in time to stop him from driving between the strands of barb wire.  We own 5 other Fisher Price Power Wheels, and have never had any accidents like this.  We've owned and used Power Wheel products for almost 5 years. The power of the Lil' Buggy, set for children age 2 and up, combined with the low statue of this buggy made for a very dangerous situation.  My child was supervised, but I wasn't able to get to him before he drove into the barb wire fence.   I ran as fast as I could to get him free, it was too late.  He had to be rushed to the ER, with a large  laceration on his neck under his chin and received 7 stitches. Here are the problems I see with this vehicle toy.1. It sits too low to the ground and very aerodynamic. 2.  It has NO windshield or other device to keep a child from driving through a barb wire fence or under a car and pinning themselves and choking to death.  It could easily go under a vehicle and pin a child, choking them or burning them (if the car had recently been on)3. This buggy goes very fast and has a lot of power, going over garden hoses and other obstacles that stop our other Power Wheel products, that results in more probability of lodging the buggy under a car/truck or through a fence such as what happened to my son. 4. My son was pinned against the barb wire fence, he was unable to reach the reverse button between his legs to get himself out of the situation.  If the child was to get pinned under a vehicle they would not be able to push the reverse button to remove themselves from under a vehicle.  5.  My son panicked and continued to push the gas pedal, as I assume most 2 year old's would and the car continued to spin the tires trying to drive forward.  I believe that a cut off switch would be a great idea on all power wheels, so that it could detect when a car/truck/others tires were spinning and it would shut off power to the battery and the car would stop.  This would keep the car from pushing the child under a vehicle or fence. I believe this Lil' Buggy should be recalled and spare other parents from what we just went through.  I will add the 5 other power wheels we own sit higher and have a hood/nose/front end with a windshield that keeps them 1' away from obstacles such as fences, vehicles or other dangers.  We followed all of the rules set forth on the instructions.  I would have never in a million years thought that it would drive the font of it through the barb wire fence as it's never happened with our other 5.  It was very scary for our family and could have been so much worse, my little boy could have died.  If it had cut his airway or jugular vein, we are so thankful and blessed that he is going to make a full recovery, we don't want anyone else to go through this.

I let go of the push handle to open the trunk of my vehicle and the trike tipped over and my son fell face first onto the pavement with the trike attached to him. This trike has the option of putting handle bars in a mode that they do not turn the front wheel when being pushed. The handle bars were disengaged as I had just finished pushing him around a track several times. I tell this because instructions state a quick sharp turn of front wheel can cause tipping. The tipping was simply caused by my son leaning a bit to one side. My son is well under the 38 pound weight limit. Fortunately he was wearing a bike helmet so his injuries were minor (facial and hand abrasions). I think a trike that is also meant to be pedaled independently by toddlers and young pre schoolers without an adult holding the handle should not tip so easily.I did report this incident to the manufacturer. They did replace it with another model that has shoulder straps as well as waist strap.

The consumer reports that his two-year-old child was injured when his 6V Stable Buddies ride-on toy “tipped over with normal designed use.” The consumer did not contact Dynacraft but Dynacraft’s product claim team has attempted to investigate the reported incident. While the consumer was not willing to speak with them on the phone and only provided minimal information via email, we understand that the consumer’s son was seated, riding his Stable Buddies ride-on and was not turning at the time of the reported fall. We also understand that nothing on the ride-on was broken. It is not clear if the consumer or anyone else witnessed the fall, and the consumer indicated that his son had previously ridden the ride-on without issue, sometimes while “standing up.” We note that the consumer’s son, at two years of age, is below the recommended age of three for the Stable Buddies. Further, the Owner’s Manual provided with the Stable Buddies indicates that the rider should remain seated while riding and that the rider should avoid sharp turns and steep inclines, among other things. Without more information, it is difficult to say what might have caused the ride-on toy to tip over as reported by the consumer, and Dynacraft’s Customer Service Manager is not aware of any similar reports. Accordingly, user error and misusecannot be ruled out as possible causes of the reported incident.",,

Toddler is 35” tall and weighs 24 pounds.The rocking horse has two yellow handles- one on each side of the horse’s head. Each handle has a button that when pressed controls the motion of the battery operated horse. The right button controls the forward backward motion and the left button controls the music. Each button is connected and soldered to 2 coated wires inside the handles.  They travel from the 6 V battery up through the horse ‘s body to the button in the handle and then back down into the body of the horse to the 6 V battery.  The other button has the same configuration of two  more wires. Because of extra  length of wiring inside the horse, if a button is removed from a handle, the wires can be pulled out longer than 12 inches. Once exposed, these two wires are able to be opened to form a loop up to 10 inches in diameter. The buttons only press into or sit in a cutout space in the plastic handles with no way to permanently connect them, snap them, or screw them in.  The buttons are able to be loosened by hand and then pulled out without the use of tools. If a button was pulled out by a child exposing the two wires connected to it, the child could easily pull the two wires open  and fit his/her head through the loop. If the small child’s head/neck became entrapped in the loop they could hang roughly 12 inches off the ground and present a scenario for strangulation. Upon contacting the manufacturer it was suggested that the product purchased by the consumer might be defective. The representative stated that he would inspect several rocking horses at the facility and try to remove the buttons from the handles. He reported back that it would require a screwdriver to pry them off. The customer then ordered a second identical rocking horse from the same manufacturer and found that the buttons in fact COULD be removed by hand just as easily as with the original rocking horse in this report camplaint.

See Youtube link"," The Razor Dune Buggy product uses a disk brake which is affixed to the product's rear axle using a set screw.  Razor has received no reports of any injury associated with the performance of the brakes, although over time there have been some reports of the set screw loosening. Notably, the process of  applying the brake with the handgrip serves to instantly cut power to the motor, and the resulting friction in the motor drive system of this low speed product will bring the product to a prompt stop.  Razor also has implemented a customer satisfaction practice of utilizing a locktite glue on the set screw for the brake disk, and will provide a substitute screw on request.  Tightening the existing screw as a matter of product inspection and maintenance, or replacing with the locktite substitute, appears to eliminate this as a potential issue.  Razor encourages parents to always check and maintain such products to minimize instances of parts loosening with use over time. ",,

I purchased Moderno Kids 1x Porsche Boxster 12V Kids Ride on car with battery powered wheels that also came with a remote control for parental control for my grand daughters 1st birthday.  However, one night while everyone was sleep the car came on by itself and the wheels of the car were turning but it did not move, both the car and the remote was downstairs in the family room.  My son in law ran downstairs to try to turn off the car but he could not get the car to cut off either by pressing the on/off switch in the car or with the remote so he had to lift the seat and detach the battery in order for the car to turn off.  At the time of the incident no one was using the ride on car, the on/off switch was off, the remote was off.  Fortunately, no one was injured.  The concern is that if the ride on car is able to come on by itself and can not be turned off with the power switch on the car or the remote control this could definitely be a safety issue/defect especially if the child is sitting in the car.  The second concern is that the battery is stored under the seat where the child is sitting and if the car won't shut off by pushing the on/off button or by the remote this could pose a safety risk to the child.  The third concern is that if no one was home and the car came on and was powered by the battery for a continuous amount of time could have resulted in overheating, fire or explosion.

We take every report of this nature very seriously hence our response below. We regret that the submitter expressed dissatisfaction with the Product. Customer satisfaction is our top priority. The submitter used and was in possession of the Product for more than 30 days before informing us that she wanted to replace it. Because she was in possession of the Product beyond our 30-day return period, as part of our customer service, we did inform the submitter that she could receive replacement parts of the Product in accordance with the terms of our warranty or allow us to inspect the Product to verify her concerns. Unfortunately, she did not exercise any of the available options. Without being afforded the opportunity to inspect the Product, we have no way of determining the substantive veracity of her claims.For the record, we have been selling the Product for about 2 years now. It is one of our best-selling products in the market. It has at least a 95% Amazon positive feedback rating, and great reviews from most of our customers thereon and on other online outlets. We sell thousands of the Product every month and have never received any complaints at all, not least of the nature alleged by the submitter. Before being released to the market, the Product underwent a battery of exhaustive testing. It meets the rigorous ASTM standards. It is ASTM approved, a prerequisite to being sold in the USA. It also meets the strict European standards on safety of toys. We have therefore met all the required safety standards and have been issued all the obligatory safety certificates as proof of this.Without questioning the motive of the submitter, the Product simply does not have the capacity nor the capability of automatically switching on of its own accord as alleged by the submitter. This is simply not possible. For it to turn on, it requires deliberate, discerning and cognizant physical action by a person.It is also important to note that the submitter appears to have purchased the Product for a 1 year old child against the clear warning and safety labels attached to the Product and specified in the product description online, as per regulatory requirements. It is rated for 2-plus year old children when used in remote model by parents. Children aged 3 years and over, can use it by themselves. In conclusion, and as earlier stated, we take every report seriously. Out of abundance of caution, we are in the process of reviewing our existing inventory of the Product to ensure and maintain the highest of safety standards.Sincerely,Serge KopilAuthorized RepresentativeModerno LLC",,

The age requirements are 1.5 - 5 years and the weight limit is 50 lb.  My child is 2 years old and weighs 28 lbs (well within the age and weight limits).The incident occurred within two days of using the product.  The truck seems to have a tendency to be unstable on hard surfaces (despite the product description pictures showing the truck being used on hard surfaces).  It is more stable on carpeted areas.On 10/17/2016 my child was sitting in the truck in our kitchen.  My mother and I were both standing right there within arm's reach of him, watching him play with the truck.  He was using it appropriately.  The door was facing away from us and he attempted to exit the truck.  He was holding onto the door of the truck for support and was re-positioning his legs to get them out of the hole in the bottom of the truck, over the seat, and onto the floor so he could exit.  However, as he was attempting to do so, the entire thing tipped over sideways and fell on top of him.  Because of the angle (the truck tipped over away from where my mother and I were standing), we were unable to grab onto the truck to keep it from tipping over.  After the whole thing fell over with my son inside, we both lifted the truck off of my son.  He had fallen out face-first onto the floor when the truck tipped over.  He was screaming and crying and bleeding from the mouth.  Both of his upper front teeth were broken.  One tooth was half gone and the other one was fractured.  Both were loose and his gums were bleeding.My child then required an emergency dental appointment where x-rays were taken to assess the damage.  He needed a seal applied on both teeth to temporarily build the broken one back up a little and coat the fractured one to protect it from breaking apart.  He also required a chest x-ray to ensure that no parts of the broken-off tooth had been aspirated (thankfully the results determined this was not the case).  After a follow-up dental appointment two weeks later, it was determined there isn't anything else that can be done to permanently fix his teeth other than to restrict him from biting into any hard/crunchy foods until he is old enough to understand that he cannot use his front teeth to bite into anything until he loses them in 4-5 years and his permanent teeth come in to replace them.  Functionally and cosmetically my child's teeth are not the same due to this incident.  It was a very traumatic experience for my child that he is still talking about and processing a month later.It's really too bad because this seemed like a cute product and my child really enjoyed playing with it prior to this incident.  However, there is a serious safety issue with the product.  This should not have happened.  There are no warnings or cautions noted anywhere on the product or packaging stating that it could tip over (although even if there had been, we would not have allowed it to be purchased for him in the first place as this is a huge safety concern for obvious reasons).  My child was using the product appropriately and under close adult supervision when the incident happened.  It is clearly an unsafe product and needs some serious renovations to better distribute the child's weight, especially as they are exiting the truck.  It should not, under any circumstances, be able to tip over when the child is getting out (or using the product in any other appropriate manner).  This is a serious design flaw that needs to be addressed immediately to prevent more kids from getting hurt.",Scappoose,Oregon,97056,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Seen by Medical Professional,Male,My Child,2.0,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,Yes,I still have the product.

The tricycle is designed to allow an adult to push the tricycle while a child is riding on it, so my husband was pushing the tricycle out of our driveway and into our residential street for its maiden voyage when the incident occurred just a short distance from our home.  While my husband was pushing the tricycle, my daughter placed her foot on the left pedal.  Although the tricycle is supposed to glide preventing the pedals from moving while the tricycle is being pushed, the pressure she applied to the left pedal engaged both pedals.  As a consequence, her right foot was grabbed by the moving right pedal.  Her foot became lodged in the space between the tire and the pedal (the zigzag metal piece that attaches the pedal to the tire) and was yanked forward.  After she began to cry, my husband immediately picked her up and brought her home.  Within about 20 minutes of the incident, we realized she could not support any weight/walk on her right foot.  We immediately took her to the urgent care clinic a few minutes from our home.  After the doctor examined the x-ray of her leg, we learned that she had suffered two buckle fractures--one on her tibia and the other on her fibula.  A splint was applied, and the next day she was fitted for a cast by an orthopedic doctor.  From the x-ray, the orthopedic doctor determined her foot did indeed get stuck in the space between the tire and the pedal and was subsequently twisted toward the right as the pedal moved--a traumatic experience for a 2 year old.  So far, she has been in a cast to immobilize her leg for almost three weeks with one more week to go before she is re-evaluated with a possible two more weeks in a new cast (at least four possibly 6-8 weeks in a cast). Obviously, there is a problem with the design of the tricycle since the pedals do not remain stationary when the tricycle is pushed by an adult and the child/rider touches the pedals.  Other tricycles have foot rests for the child to use while an adult is pushing.  With the Radio Flyer Steer and Stroll Trike, the child's legs are either left dangling near the supposedly stationary pedals or are resting on the pedals that could potentially move.  At any point during a ride, if the child applies pressure to a pedal and is not prepared for the other pedal to engage, an accident causing damage to a foot, ankle, or leg could occur no matter how old or experienced a rider the child is.  What makes the situation so much more dangerous is that the pedal is moving at the rate of the adult pushing it, which makes it difficult for a young child to catch up with the pedal.  Upon checking reviews of the tricycle since the incident, we sadly discovered we are not the only parents with a young child in a cast due to a broken leg caused by this tricycle.  With the advantage of hindsight, this is perhaps the most foolish design for a tricycle combining the strength and speed of a parent pushing the tricycle and the delicate legs of a child near pedals that could start spinning with the slightest pressure.

Every time my daughter turns a bit sharp left or right it tips over (thank god she wear a helmet). She has received scrapes on her arms and legs over the warmer weather when she was not wearing a coat or pants but again nothing major since she has always worn a helmet. At first I thought it was just because she was learning but it continued to happen even without turning and going over a bump including this last weekend. I then got curious and wanted to see what people were saying online so I went to AMAZON to read review and here are some of them stating the same thing: It tips over ALL the TIME, I got this for my daughter, who is 3. It is adorable to look at, and perfectly safe if she decides to ride in a perfectly straight line on flat ground. HOWEVER, this thing tips over and has caused my child many cuts and scrapes.DO NOT BUY. Get something that will not fall over and hurt your child. Here is another one: Bad Idea, We had a perfectly good wide based plastic trike that I replaced with this awful one. Grandma bought this Radio Flyer folding trike for my 2 year old for Christmas. I thought wow Radio Flyer! and donated the older trike. Now I am kicking myself. This Radio Flyer trike's base is not wide enough for a learner. It tips way too easily, even with just a slight turn of the handles. I keep it hidden away, so that she doesn't beg to use it very often. I only let her ride it when I am ready for heart stopping dash grabbing. I do not recommend this trike. It is not safe. here is the link for more reviews as well. http://www.amazon.com/Radio-Flyer-Girls-Fold-Trike/product-reviews/B001ULKVMU/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints=1As you can see it is a recurring issue and for a trike is not normal. Without being an Engineer I can tell you that the rear wheel base is too narrow, hence prompting tipping over all the time. It is truly not a safe product for the recommended age range and I can see a toddler not wearing a helmet getting seriously hurt.

He was okay, no bump surfaced, only a light abrasion, with redness but no blood.If you tug lightly on the side straps, the material comes through the top of the screw, allowing the child to break free.

He absolutely loves pretending to vacuum. However, this weekend, he slipped the tube off the back hook, just like a real vacuum tube would fasten around the back of a real vacuum. He put the tube around his neck and stood up, the vacuum hanging like a necklace across the front of his belly. He managed to walk up to my husband and I making little choking sounds with his face all red. The tube had somehow twisted tightly around his neck and he could not breath. Now, he had never done this before, so we were stunned he'd even thought to do something like this with a toy. My husband cut the tube off. I'm worried another child might not be so lucky.I called Dirt Devil and got a run around from them. Finally they gave me the number to a company called Creative Designs Unlimited. I got the run around from them too. Finally they gave me another number to their customer service, although whoever answered didn't answer with any professional greeting. She took my info and said they don't make this product anymore, and haven't for years. Which is crazy since this vacuum was bought about a year ago, and they are on the shelves right now in every toy store. She said they are the only makers of the toy. So I was confused on how this could be. She said they had never received a complaint before like this and she would tell the design team about it. I asked her what the design team of a product they supposedly don't make could do about a toy out there right now.

A few minutes later, I came to check on his progress of assembling the toy.  When I saw he was struggling with putting it together, I stepped in and inspected the toy.  While inspecting the toy, I found it to be in a dirty condition, where some type of substance was caked upon it.  Additionally, there were cuts and burrs in the plastic that was obviously from fabricating.  The defects and conditions in this product made it unsafe for my child to play with.  My son [REDACTED] did not damage the toy in any way.Today, 9/5/14, I was able to make a trip back to the Franklin, TN location where we had gotten the gum ball machine from.  I explained the circumstances to the manager and also showed her the gum ball machine.  The manager agreed to a refund of money spent towards the item and offered to give [REDACTED] another on-the-house because she felt bad.  Before accepting the other gum ball machine, I told her that I wanted to inspect the item.Again, there were burrs in the plastic ring around the gum ball machine where the gum ball is intended to slide down.  Additionally, the toy had a generally dirty appearance, whereas it looked like it was covered in a black substance.  I brought this to the attention of the manager and refused to accept the second gum ball machine.My issue lies in the product safety for the receiving audience: children.

It has consistently passed all testing by CPSC certified laboratories. In addition, the product is appropriately labeled for children 3+ years old, both on its packaging and on our website. While we are very sorry to hear of the incident with this customer’s 1-year-old, as clearly stated on our website and packaging, our toy is intended for children ages 3 and up due to the handling of the wooden pieces. Although all of our wooden toy components are sized for essential safety and are more than 8% larger than the federal small part tube, the wear and tear and rougher play on a wooden toy by a child younger than 3 years of age can easily lead to excessive damage to toys made of wood. Over 3,000 units of this style have been sold since its inception. We checked our records and we have not had any other incident like this reported on this product. Despite this outstanding record, we strive to address any concerns reported to us. Therefore, we reviewed all our process controls, tests, and inspections to emphasize the important assembly steps, and we continue to follow our sound testing program for product compliance.

(A picture of this toy is available here: http://www.infantino.com/product.cfm?product_id=1115 .) Our 21-month-old son managed to get one side of this toy to break apart. This is the side of the toy that contains two spinning rectangles--one pink and one green. When this portion of the toy came apart, this resulted in two yellow peg-like pieces, small enough to be choking hazards, separating from the toy. We found our son with one of these pieces in his mouth. We are still trying to find the other piece. We wanted to express a concern about the fact that the toy came apart and that, when it did, choking hazards were produced. Please note that this toy is typically played with on the carpet or inside a [playpen].  This toy is one of many toys in our son's toy baskets and is played with occasionally but not daily.  I have also contacted Infantino directly about this incident (I sent the company a description and photographs of what happened to the toy).  Infantino has requested that I return the broken activity triangle toy directly to them so that their engineers can examine it, and as soon as I receive mailing materials from them, I will be doing so.

The top portion of Baby Stella's bottle contains a magnet so that it will stay on Stella's mouth to appear that the baby is drinking from the bottle.   After several months of regular use, the tip of the bottle became frayed and a hole appeared.  My husband found my daugther playing with her doll and bottle in her room, however, the magnet came out and was stuck to the baby's face.  Luckily, my daughter pointed this out and handed it over to my husband.  After examining the pacifier that came with Baby Stella, it appears the magnet inside it will break through if the fabric is torn in the tiniest way.  The magnet is right under the fabric.  This is obviously a hazard in that the magnet can be ingested and cause internal issues.

I am very sorry to hear that you have had an unpleasant experience with one of our products. I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to let us know what happened. If a product should fail to meet any of our customer’s expectations, we are always interested to learn more. I want to also assure you that we put great effort in making sure all of our children’s products are as safe as possible. All of our products are tested with a CPSIA accredited lab and must successfully pass all standards and regulations before we accept them or sell them to our customers. We always take a proactive stance against any product flaws at Elegant Baby, and hearing our customers’ feedback is an excellent tool for us.  Unfortunately, due to the nature of the product (being a water use product), we do hear about mold growth from time to time. To better aid our customers, we have begun including a care instruction insert into all of our squirties and bath toys, which warn of this and also provide more detailed cleaning instructions. I included a copy of our recommended cleaning and care instructions in my original correspondence with you. There is no place to attach it here but I will be glad to resend it to you if you provide your email address. Please note that product lifespan can last from months to years, depending on care and the specific environment. If mildew forms and cleaning does not remove or stop growth, we recommend that our customer please replace the product. As always, please use your own best judgement. We have had some customers whose squirties required minimal cleaning and have lasted for years without mold issues. However, we have also had some customers who report issues after just a couple of months, despite cleaning or otherwise taking preventative/good care of the items. After discussing in depth with our lab, we feel as though environment and individual conditions play a big variable in determining mold growth (storage, water, air humidity, etc.). This has nothing to do with the cleanliness of a customer’s home or the quality of their water. It can take just a drop of water combined with the general humidity of the environment to begin mildew and mold growth. This is not something that is unique to our products, but seen across the board with bath toys of this nature.Please know that our products themselves do not contain any additives that would promote mold growth, outside of the general use and design. At this time, we have elected against adding additional chemicals to our baby toys as mold inhibitors, keeping bath time as safe as possibleI’d be more than happy to send you out a replacement set of squirties or another item of your choice at no charge. However, I must caution that this could possibly happen again. Please follow the care instructions to ensure the longest life possible for your squirties. I will need your mailing address to send you a replacement. You can respond privately to my email address provided below.  If you have any additional questions or concerns, please let me know!  Please send me your mailing address and a phone number so that we may ship out a replacement set to you as soon as possible.Thank you for being an Elegant Baby customer!Best Regards, Libby Odom, Executive Vice President    Elegant Babylibbyodom@elegantbaby.com  Visit us online",,

There are four facts of which you should be aware:1. All of Ty's products are tested by an independent testing agency for compliance with U.S. safety standards, and DARLIN is no exception. This product was specifically tested to ensure that it complies with all applicable safety regulations and standards, including safety standards relating to small parts. The test results establish full compliance with CPSC regulations and safety standards.2. The hang tag attached to this product specifically and conspicuously states that the product is designed for children aged 3 and older. It is not designed for a two year old like the complainant's child.3. The hang tag also contains a warning that the hang tag be retained for reference, and it appears the purchase did not heed this warning.4. Given the French language labeling and the fact the product in question was purchased in Texas on clearance, there is the distinct possibility that this piece is either counterfeit or a secondary market product that may have been damaged well after it was originally shipped by Ty.Ty employs strict quality control measure to ensure that its products are safe for children. If requested, Ty will gladly provide the CPSC with all test reports for its DARLIN product.",,

There is also an internal protection circuit to limit current in case of incorrect polarity between batteries.  If a damaged battery without proper insulation was forced into the compartment and the contact spring was also damaged and touched both the exposed + and – surfaces of the battery causing a short circuit there is a chance it might overheat.  However, if the product is used in the manner indicated in the instruction manual the batteries will not overheat.  2.

I have contacted the manufacturer through their customer service website, alerting them that I was filing with the CPSC as well as requested that the company management contact me"," We appreciate your bringing this matter to our attention. The complainant also brought this matter to our attention, and we have been working to resolve this matter to the complainant’s satisfaction. That said, please be assured that Ty Inc. makes every reasonable effort to ensure the safety of its products. We take great steps to ensure that our products are safe, and all of our products, including the product in question, are safety tested prior to their introduction in the market to ensure compliance with all CPSC regulations and standards, including any and all applicable CPSIA requirements. Our internal quality control procedures are also designed to prevent needles or any other foreign objects from being accidentally enclosed within our plush toys. Claims such as this are extremely rare. A couple of points do need to be made. First and foremost, the complainant advised us that no injury of any nature (minor or otherwise) occurred. Second, the complainant advised that the needle was located in the front leg of the plush toy animal (in the CPSC report, the complainant advised the needle was in the front foot, but we do not believe this is a material discrepancy). Importantly, there is no hand stitching in this area of the plush toy in question, and there would be no reasons for a needle to be anywhere near the front leg/foot. In addition, from the photograph taken, the needle appears to be a standard sewing needle. Typically, needles used in the manufacture of plush toys are much longer. Accordingly, we believe it is more likely than not that the needle was introduced into the product at some point after the manufacturing process through no fault of ours. The complainant had agreed to send us the needle for our examination, but to date we have not received it and consequently cannot comment further on its possible source.  ",,

This particular set consisted of six or seven Cars that had Ground Effects or lights on the underside of the Car. Some had blue lights, others purple or green. This toy was marketed right at his eye level. There were no visible warnings on the box that this toy was not for children. Of course, his grandfather bought him the toy. All was well for the first week. Within a week of buying the toy, I found him in his room crying Oh, no Mater I investigated to find that Mater's impercetibly tiny (smaller than a pop tab) hook had broken off the back of the truck. I quickly found the hook and took it away, as I felt it could have been a choking hazard. I let my son continue to play with the rest of Mater, since I believed that all the small parts had broken off. I continued to closely supervise my son playing with the toy, but within a day or two, I had stepped away again, and again heard crying. This time, Mater's sport spoiler had broken off, leaving a jagged plastic edge, which was sharp to the touch. This time, I took Mater away for good.  My son absolutely adored this toy, but it was both a choking and laceration hazard in the same toy. I have let him continue to play with the other cars in the set (which all have the same sport spoilers) but only under close supervision. He is not left alone with these toys. The set was on sale for $20. at the Disney store in the weeks leading up to Christmas, and I observed a LOT of people buying them.

This is unusual for this item since it does contain an automatic shut-off aft. 30 seconds of being switched on moreover we pulled in random products taken from inventory and could not duplicate the problem.  Without having the defective product in hand to complete a thorough investigation as to what the cause might have been makes it extremely difficult.  Our internal sampling and testing of the item could not duplicate the condition. ,,

I didn't realize it had happened until I saw one of my 14 month old twins with a screw in their mouth, and the other with sharp slivers of wood in her hands.  I'm quite concerned that this is a product default - the lid was never slammed, the product was installed correctly.  The wooden block appears to be made of partical board, not solid block, so only the middle part broke apart. the two ends remain intact.

It is a stethoscope from a Disney Doc McStuffins All Better Bath Kit (7pc set) which they just received for Christmas. It was missing the two ear bud pieces and instead there were two sharp points. It did not come like that and we have since found both pieces but I can not let my daughters play with their new toy now since those pieces come off very easy and this toy could damage their ears if they happen to put the ends in their ears without the ear buds on it. I contacted Disney that same day and I have sent them all the information and pictures and they then sent the information to the company who made the toy. I just heard back from them today and although very polite they told me these toys go through all kinds of testing like pull and drop testing and this toy has passed all current safety standards. If that is the case then the safety standards should be updated to also state that sharp objects meant to be put in or near your ears are dangerous and not safe. We have a couple other stethoscopes from other various Doc McStuffins toys/sets and they all have the molded ear sets which are part of the whole unit and not separate. I understand the choking hazard of possible small pieces from these toys but this stethoscope is meant for pretend play and what you do with a stethoscope is put it in your ears. This is not safe for that. The ear pieces did not just fall off and I am going to assume my girls pulled one off accidentally and then saw how easily it came off and pulled the other one off. My concern isn't the pieces coming off easily or not, it is the fact that there are sharp points under those ear buds. The ear pieces should either be one unit with the stethoscope, or at the very LEAST the plastic under the ear buds should be rounded.",Wynantskill,New York,12198,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,My Child,,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,They said this product meets all current safety standards,,,

We went to toy section of Target where they had a variety foam dart guns to choose from.  The toy she selected for herself was a Nerf Pro Sender which was on the shelf with all the other toy guns.  When we arrived home we setup the gun and fired a test shot to see how it operated.  As my daughter bent over to pick up the dart across the yard, I fired at her and hit her in the buttocks.  She immediately started screaming and crying.  I had my wife fire the gun at me to experience the feeling first hand and was shocked my how powerful the gun was and that it left a welt on my skin through jeans.Upon closer inspection of the packaging we realized the unqualified 14+ printed on the front meant 14 years of age or older.  The warning, found on front of all foam dart guns, indicated that it was not a toy and intended for people 14 years of age or older.  The warning is a simple white text on a grey background that in no way stands out compared to anything else on the packaging.I feel like the warnings and age restrictions printed on the box are done so a way to make them difficult to interpret and easily overlooked.  By the manufacturer's own claim, it is not a toy yet it is packaged and sold as a toy in the toy section of the store.

My 4 year old granddaughter was carrying the toy and dropped it on a concrete floor and parts were dislodged. When examining the toy, I was completely surprised by what I found. Two of the 1.5 Button Cell batteries had fallen out onto the floor due to the screw (holding the batteries in) had actually broke allowing the compartment to pop open and spill the 1.5 Button Cell batteries to the floor. I have a one year old grandson I thought of immediately. It would be nothing for his quick response to scoop up such items and choke or even swallowing these batteries. I returned the toys to Wal Mart in Bloomington IN. I asked the customer service associate to call a manager so I may report the possible hazard and suggest it be removed from the shelves. He agreed there was a defect and said he would contact the toy department. Approx. 20 min. later I was in the toy department and saw nothing was done. I do not feel comfortable leaving this up to a few Wal Mart associates to do the right thing, so I am contacting you with this matter.

Because of the colors and shapes, I thought it seemed like it would be an educational toy for her. Yesterday we received the toy through amazon.com, and played with it for the first (and only) time. During the time playing, I did not notice that one of the tiles came apart, spilling six tiny magnets. I am not sure when it split open. My daughter is two years old, so we were not throwing the tiles or playing with them in any odd way. I discovered that one of the tiles had opened when I started to clean up and put the tiles away, back in the Picasso Tiles box, and found only half a tile. I realized immediately that the magnets were no longer in the piece, and searched frantically for the six tiny magnets, worried that my very agile child would find them. Luckily I quickly located all six magnets. Shaken, I read the box, where there was a warning label stating that death could occur if the magnets are ingested - the magnets could cause the intestines to stick together. I couldn't believe that a product such as this is available for consumer consumption. It was the first time we had played with the toy, and one of the pieces had inadvertently fallen apart. I am very worried for other families who may not be aware of the dangers of this toy, and might leave their children alone to play with it, not realizing that this is a poorly made product and could spill magnets everywhere. (The magnets are so small that I had a hard time finding them - some were in the box, and some were stuck to other pieces.) The toy was very expensive, and the packaging nice, so one would assume that it is a high quality product. It is not. I am very fearful that little children could be harmed by this toy. I returned the toy to amazon.com today.Thank you, [REDACTED]",New York,New York,10128,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,My Child,2.0,No,No,,,No,No,No,,,,

My son was within the age limits and was using the toy according to its use.  The battery compartment is contained in a fabric compartment secured by velcro that is easily opened - even by a toddler.   The fabric pocket does not adequately fit the battery compartment - it is difficult to re-insert the battery compartment in the pocket once it has been pulled out.  While sleeping or playing with the toy, the battery compartment also seems to wiggle its way out of the pocket and applies pressure to the velco loosening it.  Due to the ease of access to the battery department and its wires, I feel this poses multiple hazards to a child who may bite or chew on them.

There is a velcro release on the guitar strap but it did not release when it was twisted around my daughters neck. We immediately cut the straps off completely and my daughter plays with it that way but I am afraid of this very attractive toy being left along with another unsuspecting child and resulting in strangulation.

When I Googled this company School Specialty popped up as the seller.  After contacting them they told me they no longer sell this particular toy.  I could not get any further information about this particular toy.This toy consists of 6 different colored vinyl balls that have very small magnets embedded at each end of the balls.  When the balls get close enough to each other they connect forming a Worm.  One of my toddlers here actually was able to chew one of the magnets out of the end of one of the balls.  This had to have taken quite a bit of work on her part as the vinyl seems rather thick around the area where the magnets are embedded.  Luckily her teacher caught her just as she was able to get the magnet out.  No harm done to anyone.

This toy is a kitchen with two halves that are hinged and designed to open and close.  The problem we are having is that as our daughter grabs and pulls and the various things on the toy, it falls over and the two halves slam shut with her fingers between.  This has happened twice in two days.  The first time, we weren't in the room when it happened, but upon hearing her crying, came in to discover her hand caught between the halves with her on top, so her body weight was bearing down on her pinched hand.  We thought it was a freak accident and decided to try letting her play with it again.  This time, we were closely supervising, and again she grabbed at the toy causing it to fall over and slam shut with her fingers caught between the halves.  This time her fingers were close to the hinge side, increasing the pressure on her fingers.  Neither incident resulted in serious injury because we were able to respond very quickly, but both times did leave a significant indention in her fingers and a bruise.  Since she would have been unable to free her hand by herself, it would have been much more serious if someone was not close by to help.  The plastic is quite thin on one side, so it does not take much pressure to really cut into little fingers.  I have since read reviews on the toy on Walmart.com, Toysrus.com, and Target.com and found many other people have the same complaint with the toy.",Sylacauga,Alabama,35150,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - No First Aid or Medical Attention Received,Female,My Child,-1.0,Yes,No,,,No,No,,,,,

I did have this ooze in my hands for about 30 minutes longer than my son so I assume this is why. The day after playing I woke up feeling ill and nauseated which lasted most of the day.  I'm not sure if this is a coincidence or not.  I have researched consumer reviews and nearly every review is a complaint of this horrid taste even describing it as battery acid.  One person reported that their child threw up after playing with it.  The taste did not fully fade from my hands and lips until Saturday April 13.

Upon closer inspection the small plastic film ( about 5.5mm by 4mm) was loose and came out.

Terrified, I left work and drove as fast as I could to Rady's. When I got there, thank everything, my son was breathing and part of the toy- a button battery- had been extracted from his airway. However, he had some swelling, a raspy voice, and was unable to swallow, leading doctors to think there might be more parts of the toy still caught in his airway or esophagus. They had to take him to the operating room, put him to sleep under general anesthesia, insert an artificial airway into his trachea and put him on the ventilator (life support) so that they could send scopes down both his airway and his esophagus to ensure there wasn't any other foreign body present.There wasn't, but they did find laryngeal swelling and irritation from where the battery had come to rest (and cut off air supply!) in his airway. There was evidence of bleeding from the trauma to his airway as well. They gave him steroids and he was monitored. It took a long time for him to wake up from anesthesia and every second was agony while we waited in the waiting room, separate from our son, not knowing what was going on or if he was okay.Our story had a happy ending- he ended up being okay and was discharged home later on. But it so easily could have gone another way. The button battery was lodged deep, deep in his airway. The ENT doctor who performed the procedure showed us how it had caused irritation to his vocal cords and explained that aside from lye, button batteries are one of the most toxic things you can ingest. He asked where the battery had come from.And here's the thing. Here's the thing. It came from a toy. It came from a toy, from the Target dollar spot. One of those silly Halloween toy wands where you bang the head of the pumpkin and it lights up. The ones marked ages three and up.Well, guess what. My son IS three and up and this still happened. All he had to do was bang the head of that pumpkin and it came flying off, exposing the battery assembly. I don't care what age a toy is marked as, children should NEVER have direct access to the batteries that run them. This was a cheap, silly toy that I bought because I thought it would make him smile. It almost killed him instead. PLEASE don't buy this toy for your children. The risk is simply unacceptable and I would hate for any other child to go through what mine went through.

This toy was designed very poorly by the Mattel corporation. I bought this as a present for my five year old granddaughter. The stairs will not hold in place at all. The stairs kept falling apart and the edges of the stairs are very sharp. My granddaughter kept trying to connect the edges of the stairs together so she could use the stairs and she scratched herself and ran to me crying. I'm glad that she only got scratched and didn't get hurt more because of this toy. The second floor of this doll house and everything on it will not stay in place. I am afraid that it is going to fall apart because of the bad quality of the plastic. The Mattel corporation claims that this product is appropriate for 4-7 year olds, but I don't believe it is because there are so many tiny pieces in this castle. Princess Jasmine's carpet on the side of this product will not move up and down at all. It gets stuck every time my granddaughter tries to push it up and down the side of the product like its supposed to.

On Sunday she had them in her hand and was standing a couple inches from our back sliding glass french door. The magnets slipped from her hand, hit the tile floor, broke into 5 or so pieces and one of the pieces shot through the bottom of the glass - shattering the entire glass from top to bottom. We are very lucky this door is only 3 years old and from my understanding because it is tempered glass, the glass did not shatter all over her.I filed and incident report with [REDACTED] from the company that makes this toy - and asked they pay for the repairs for the door and as well take this toy off the market. Company info is as follows:Ja-RuJacksonville Office904-733-9311http://www.jaru.com/contact.htmlThree things of interest - 1) the toy is suppose to be thrown in the air so the magnets will click together & make a sizzle noise but that if it hits a hard surface it could break - it does not say to catch the magnets after you throw them so they don't hit a hard surface 2) it warms the toy should be immediately discarded if broken - [REDACTED] from the company said there was lead in this toy but supposedly a safe level - lead is not safe - why would any children's toy have any lead in it at all. 3) the packaging warns how strong these magnets are and that they can suddenly attach to metal objects causing damage to the object or pinching/bruising of the skin. It just so happens there is a whole piece of metal at the bottom of the glass in the door - very close to where the magnet shot through & shattered it. As a side note I have been in  touch with the manufacturer of the door - [REDACTED]. They can not believe a magnet would even remotely have the strength to shatter their glass. This is basically a new 3 year old door with high end insulated double paned glass  - no toy should be able to cause this kind of damage from dropping from a child's hand. I have made a number of follow up phone calls and was finally able to speak to [REDACTED] from the Ja-Ru company yesterday.  He is refusing to take any liability for the damage and does not think his toy is unsafe. In summary I am looking for the proper way to have Ja-Ru pay the cost of repair for the door, a way other consumers can be notified of the danger of this product given what happened to us and a way for this product to be taken off the market.Kind regards,[REDACTED]",Irvington,New York,10533,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,My Child,8.0,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,Contacted company on 11/4/13 and filed incident report. ,,,

A 2-year and 8-month-old child participated in the demolition process and was injured by contact with broken parts. We are sorry to hear this but we have three points to make:1. The small parts are produced by adults in the process of removing the packaging, not by children in normal play. The injury caused by improper unpacking efforts is a random individual case with rare probability. 2. There is an age label and warning on the packaging, indicating that the car product is suitable for children over 3 years old. The probable cause of this case was the involvement of children below the applicable age in the dismantling process and the lack of adult supervision and protection. 3. The product has passed the US children's toy safety test and meets the standards (Please see the attached report for details). At the same time, we will also investigate the product to prevent similar incidents from happening. To sum up, the injuries caused by the simultaneous occurrence of three conditions: adults forcefully dismantled the packaging, and children below the warning age participated in the dismantling process without adult supervision, which is not enough to prove that there is a safety problem with the product itself.

After coming home from the ER I found her entire nail attached to the stroller. ,San benito,Texas,78586,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Emergency Department Treatment Received,Female,My Child,2.0,Yes,No,,,No,No,,The product is put away in another room," We were very concerned to learn of this incident involving a Graco Toy Doll Stroller manufactured by Tollytots.  Incidents we learn of are thoroughly investigated and addressed with care as the safety of our consumers and their children is our utmost priority. This incident is no different, as we have thoroughly reviewed the consumer’s experience and will also review their product which they will be sending back to us. This product and packaging were reviewed, tested and assessed for ages 3 and up.  The product packaging and instructions are marked clearly with suitable warnings, instructions and an appropriate age grading, and independent lab testing confirmed that the product was in conformity with applicable standards.  According to our conversation with the consumer, the child was playing in another room alone and was unsupervised at the time of the incident so the family does not know how or what caused the stroller to collapse on her finger.   Fortunately, the child is recovering well and the injury is healing properly.  The consumer believes this was nothing more than a “freak accident” as there had been no prior problems with the product leading up to the incident.  The consumer is pleased that we are sending her a care package for her child which will also include a prepaid label for the return of the stroller to us.  Please note that based on the pictures of the stroller from the consumer, it appears to be an older style that was later redesigned.  Finally, since the child was only 25 months old at the time of the incident, this reiterates the importance of adult supervision and respect for age appropriateness when interacting with our products.  As noted above, we investigate all incidents as safety is paramount. If appropriate, we incorporate any needed changes to the product or instructions for future production. Tollytots is committed to continuous learning and growth while making high quality and innovative children’s products.  Tollytots encourages consumers to contact us by calling our Consumer Relations line at 1-888-438-8808, or by emailing us at <a href=mailto:info@tollytots.com>info@tollytots.com</a> with any questions and concerns about Tollytots products.",,

Then, the child pushes a button and the fairy flies up from the base.  In theory, the fairy goes up and down based on whether or not there is a hand underneath her.  My concern with this product is that my older daughter was looking at the fairy, getting ready to play with it.  She had not tied back her hair.  My younger daughter rushed over and pushed the button.  Upon doing so, predictably, the fairy lifted from the base and immediately got tangled in my daughter's hair - from the ends to three-quarters of the way to her scalp.  My daughter has waist-length hair.  I have read other reviews online since returning the product for a refund and understand that this is not an isolated incident.

The zipper is easily opened by a child leaving them subject to finding the loose magnets and placing them in their mouths which is a choking hazard at the very least and a situation that could be fatal should a child swallow more than one causing them to attract to each other within the child’s body.  The company is offering no solution to the problem besides “removing the magnets and placing them on your fridge”.  The magnets were advertised as being sewn completely shut in the covers and were changed some time during production with no warning to consumers.  There is also no warning label or information sheet that accompanies this toy letting consumers know that it even contains magnets at all.  Nor does this product carry any kind of bar code that should be present according to the CSPC for children’s toys/furniture.

The incident described below occurred on the same day of purchase.After he flew it for a few minutes, one of the motors appeared to stop working and then the helicopter started smoking.

Thinking that I had made a mistake, I switched the power switch again and the rotors continued to turn.  The decorative lights were blinking on and off as well, regardless of what position the power switch was in.This toy is clearly a fire hazard and we find it suspicious that the instruction manual states that the helicopter should not be left unattended when charging.  It takes 2 hours to charge and I can't think of very many people that are going to baby sit a toy for 2 hours while it charges; clearly though, this helicopter should not be left alone!A final note, which may or may not be related -- the instructions stated that the charger had a light that would come on when the helicopter was fully charged.  However, the charger that came with this helicopter did not have a light.

Yes, they grow in sizeaccording to instructions, but are still very small and very slippery. The box it is packaged in says for 3+,' theinstruction booklet says 5+. Even at that age, I feel the blobs are extremely dangerous the young kids. I actuallysee no use for this toy. Maya (or actual person responsible for converting to a toy) just exploited this technologicaladvancement purely for profit. Though that is a way of life and part of our freedom, putting a dangerous toy out isagainst all safety concerns of many for years now. I did advise my son (his father) and when he saw what it was anddid, he told me to trash it. Please look ito it, please. A young child could so easily swallow these miniature, slipperypellets, or slip on them. They ultimately would just be looked at then thrown around, leaving a potential accidentto happen.

I found the phone number on the box and called them. They talked it off like it was nothing. They said they didn't think the toy was dangerous and they had no complaints. What needs to happen someone reall get hurt on the toy before they will do anything. They didn't seem to care. I think they owe me $50.00 for my good jeans that was ripped on their product. They should be thankful I didn't go to the hospital for the gash it put in my rear. I don't think its too much to aske them to pay for my jeans. I think the toy should be taken off the market before someone really gets hurt on it. I eceived a replay from the attorney General's office. They said you would be taken care of the matter with the Playmobile. I hope you are able to do something before someone else gets hurt with this toy. The points are way too sharp and a child could very easily get hurt really bad. I warned them but they didn't think it was anything to be worried about. The always is a first time for something really bad to happen, but they didn't take my warning. I shpuld of went to the hospital for the bad cut it put on my backside and it ripped through my good jeans. Now they tell me this toy isn't dangerous. I think the least they can do is pay for my jeans. They wouldn't even take the tag back for a refund. I took it apart and put it back in the box. My child is not getting hurt on this toy.

My son developed a blister rash on his finger where he touched it.Upon inspection I realized the underside of the resin was unable to cure since there is no way for Uv light to penetrate through the opaque macaroni used. Therefore only the top layer of the resin was cured, while the bottom layer remained wet (this particular kit was completed months ago & cured under a UV light + was left out in the sun for several hours) I am aware that unused miniverse products have been recalled, but even some of the competed cured products still carry the a risk, since many use either opaque resin or products. We have checked our other completed miniverse toys & discovered several of the ones we have already completed (per the included instructions) still have  uncured resin: the popcorn bowl (resin under opaque popcorn top layer cannot cure), the holiday chocolate drink set & the appliance coffee set (only the top layer of the opaque brown resin is cured), the macaroons (only  outer edge of frosting was cured / resin in between opaque cookies remained uncured)I am sure there are many other sets (that we dont have) that are flawed as well. The utilization of opaque products is poorly designed, since it renders a complete UV curing process impossible.Due to this flawed design, I believe the current Miniverse  recall (for only unused kits) is insufficient.

While we understand the consumer’s concern about the fastening of the eye to the plush cat, we are relieved to know that there is no injury involved in this incident as the safety of our consumers and their children is our utmost priority.Independent laboratory testing confirmed that this product and packaging conformed to applicable standards and are marked clearly with suitable warnings, instructions and an age grade of 3+.  In addition, the plush cat’s eye was constructed such that the eye contains a back washer for support and was heat stamped on the end of the eye pole for further safety redundancy.    We investigate all inquiries and incidents, and if appropriate, we incorporate any needed changes to the product or instructions for future production. Since individual circumstances are unique and safety is our top priority, we normally contact the consumer to collect further details to help us to better understand the issue and address any concerns.  In this case, our Consumer Relations team spoke with the consumer to collect further details about the incident.  The consumer did see that the child was bouncing the cat on the floor, but was unsure how the cat’s eye ended up in her child’s mouth.  Fortunately, the consumer discovered it in time and removed the eye out of her child’s mouth before an injury could occur.  The consumer also mentioned that she purchased the product originally a few years ago for her older child, but recently gave it to her 18-month-old child involved here.  While it is fortunate that the parent was paying attention to her child, this incident reiterates the importance of adequate adult supervision and respect for age appropriateness and maturity of children who should be allowed to interact with our products.  To help satisfy the consumer, we sent her a prepaid shipping label to return the product to us for our review and upon receipt we will send back to her an appropriate replacement product.

It can best be described as looking like a small, 4-spoke Ferris wheel with small fixed objects in place of seats. It features a suction cup bottom & each of the spokes contains one of the following spinning objects: a musical rattling ladybug, a pair of textured paddles, an acrylic ball containing a mirror, & a cylyndrical acrylic rattle. My husband & I purchased it in March, from our local Target store (although, when the incident prompted me to search for info, the Target website didn't list the toy for either online or in-store availability). On April 19, 2011, our son was playing with the age-appropriate toy when he began screaming. His hand, up to just past his wrist, was caught between the spinning acrylical ball and spinning acrylic tube rattler. Together, they acted as a set of rollers that made it easier for his arm to reach deeper into the toy. When he tried to free himself, he twisted his arm, catching his wrist & making it even more difficult to remove. I tried rolling the ball and tube rattler outward in an attempt to ease his hand out. This caused him more pain & screaming as his wrist was sideways and the spinning toys are affixed close enough to make entrapment easy, but escape nearly impossible. I then tried folding his little thumb in toward his palm. This didn't work either. I tried pulling the spinning components apart, hoping it would give. At this point, his hand, wrist, & forearm were red & swelling. I tried rotating the toy, instead of his wrist, hoping to match the angle at which his arm entered. This entire frightening event lasted roughly 2-3 minutes. He screamed in pain so hard, I had to repeatedly blow on his forehead to help him catch his breath. After what seemed like hours, I was reaching for the phone with intent to call 911 because I was afraid the toy would require being cut off & he was having difficulty breathing through his wailing. I made one last attempt to free his arm and with MUCH maneuvering & as much patience as we could muster, he was able to pull his hand out as I held it in position. I wrapped his hand and arm in a cool cloth until he stopped screaming. I inspected his wrist & didn't find any surface injuries. He was on the floor and crawling around within minutes, and without difficulty. This morning, however, he woke with mild bruises on, and just above, his wrist.

We investigate all incident reports thoroughly.  In early 2012, a small number of online consumer complaints stated that inserting a battery backwards (i.e., reversing the polarity) had led to remote control failures.  That is a scenario against which we have always warned in the product’s robust battery safety warnings and battery diagrams.  Nevertheless, when we received the reports, we further validated through additional safety testing that there is no serious safety risk associated with reversing the polarity. In the case of this complaint, we have not had a chance to examine the unit or the battery used in it.  The product has undergone extensive quality assurance, product safety and quality control testing (including recent additional third-party safety testing), and none of the testing has identified a likelihood of failure or unreasonable safety risk associated with this product.  Having distributed this product in high volume for several years we are unaware of any reported injuries associated with the use of the product.  Nevertheless, in response to this consumer incident and out of an abundance of caution, our team of engineers will continue to investigate and take any necessary corrective action.",,

MerchSource takes all product safety and consumer satisfaction issues very seriously. We investigate all incident reports thoroughly. In early 2012, a small number of online consumer complaints stated that inserting a battery backwards (i.e., reversing the polarity) had led to remote control failures. That is a scenario against which we have always warned in the product’s robust battery safety warnings and battery diagrams. Nevertheless, when we received the reports, we further validated through additional safety testing that there is no serious safety risk associated with reversing the polarity. In the case of this complaint, we have not had a chance to examine the unit or the battery used in it. The product has undergone extensive quality assurance, product safety and quality control testing (including recent additional third-party safety testing), and none of the testing has identified a likelihood of failure or unreasonable safety risk associated with this product. Having distributed this product in high volume for several years we are unaware of any reported injuries associated with the use of the product. Nevertheless, in response to this consumer incident and out of an abundance of caution, our quality team will continue to investigate and take any necessary corrective action.",,

If I had not been right there he would have choked or cut his mouth up pretty good.  I feel this is very dangerous and could cause allot of harm to a child.  It didn't hit the floor very hard and it broke in half.  I can't imagine if a baby was banging it on a table or something like they love to do with toys. It would probably brake into even smaller pieces! I would like to keep baby's safe and get this taken care of.  I contacted the company also.

The bunny's eye had fallen out -- a half-inch plastic screw -- and our 18-month-old daughter had put it in her mouth. Fortunately our nanny was watching on the monitor and our 18-month-old did not choke. No one was harmed but this story could have ended very differently.The bunny is a white, plush, soft and snuggly baby toy. It was given to us as a gift between 2011 and 2014 (either for our older daughter's birth or for our younger daughter's birth) but I don't know where it was purchased or who gave it to us. It does, however, have a series of tags on it. Photos attached.The bunny has a small tag that says it is for decoration, not meant as a toy. But ... really?

The objective of this study was to identify battery ingestion outcome predictors and trends, define the urgency of intervention, and refine treatment guidelines.METHODS:Data were analyzed from 3 sources: (1) National Poison Data System (56535 cases, 1985-2009); (2) National Battery Ingestion Hotline (8648 cases, July 1990-September 2008); and (3) medical literature and National Battery Ingestion Hotline cases (13 deaths and 73 major outcomes) involving esophageal or airway button battery lodgment.RESULTS:All 3 data sets signal worsening outcomes, with a 6.7-fold increase in the percentage of button battery ingestions with major or fatal outcomes from 1985 to 2009 (National Poison Data System). Ingestions of 20- to 25-mm-diameter cells increased from 1% to 18% of ingested button batteries (1990-2008), paralleling the rise in lithium-cell ingestions (1.3% to 24%). Outcomes were significantly worse for large-diameter lithium cells (> or = 20 mm) and children who were younger than 4 years. The 20-mm lithium cell was implicated in most severe outcomes. Severe burns with sequelae occurred in just 2 to 2.5 hours. Most fatal (92%) or major outcome (56%) ingestions were not witnessed. At least 27% of major outcome and 54% of fatal cases were misdiagnosed, usually because of nonspecific presentations. Injuries extended after removal, with unanticipated and delayed esophageal perforations, tracheoesophageal fistulas, fistulization into major vessels, and massive hemorrhage.CONCLUSIONS:Revised treatment guidelines promote expedited removal from the esophagus, increase vigilance for delayed complications, and identify patients who require urgent radiographs.PMID: 20498173 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE] Free full textPublication Types, MeSH TermsLinkOut - more resources",Cleveland,Ohio,44022,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",,My Child,4.0,No,No,,,No,Yes,,Emailed manufacturer,,,

Her arm twisted and wrist bent with the bend of the chute. It took nearly 20 minutes to free her using olive oil and trying to unscrew the train. Several things complicated the matter. I couldn't remove the wheels, because they had an irreversible lock screw, so I couldn't easily access the bottom to unscrew it, and they also prevented me from prying apart the train all the way, making it difficult to unscrew. The tube was attached to an electrical panel for reading the blocks on one side. If she had been on the wrong side of the train, I wouldn't have been able to free her. Also, a couple screws inside of the train holding tube together were stripped, so I was only able to open one side of the tube. Fortunately, I could calm her down enough to stay still and let me remove it at home, but I was terrified of twisting or moving the train in a way that would snap her wrist or arm.

We bought the toy around 4:00pm. At around 7:30pm, he was playing with the SPLAT BALL in our living room and began squeezing it back and forth when it burst and the contents of the ball was shot in his face and in his eyes. We flushed his eyes for nearly 3 minutes while he continued to scream for us to take him to the hospital because he couldn't see. We went to the ER, where he was treated with pain medicine, had several eye exams, and was eventually sedated in order to irrigate his Left eye, which apparently got the worst of the gel contents from the ball. We arrived at the ER around 7:45pm on March 12, 2011 and left around 12:30am on March 13, 2011. His discharge diagnosis was corneal abrasion and chemicals to the eye. We were told to follow-up with the on-call eye doctor on Sunday afternoon, March 13, 2011.  At that appointment, he was tested further and it was determined that his vision was effected. We were told to follow-up with our own pediatric eye doctor on Monday, March 14, 2011, where the doctor stated that he has 3 corneal abrasions and a secondary bacterial infection in the left eye caused from the contaminated contents of the gel in the ball. We are giving my son antibiotic eye drops and gel as directed and have a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to make sure his vision has returned to normal, as it is still effected by the chemicals. Because this toy was so new, we still have all the original packaging and took it with us to the ER and doctor appointments. However, there is no contents listed on the package, which made it difficult for ER staff to know how to treat his injuries. Everyone was unsure what chemicals were in the gel that damaged his eyes. I contacted the Ja-Ru Toy Company this morning to obtain the contents list to take to our follow-up visit. I was SHOCKED at the list of chemicals in this TOY. Most of them have serious warnings of eye irritation, blistering of the eyes and skin, as well as permanent corneal damage.

He was coughing and whimpering and couldn't figure out how to unravel the cord when he came to me. I quickly unwound the cord from his neck, and thankfully he was okay. There was a red mark around his neck for the next thirty minutes after the event. Thankfully Nothing terrible happened, but I can only imagine if he hadn't come to me right away. We have had several conversations prior to this about the dangers of cords around the neck, especially since he has younger siblings.

The only possible solution to prevent the transmission wire from wrapping around children’s necks is to shorten the length of the wire to less than 220mm.  However, this change will significantly affect the play value of the vehicle as children would have to control the toy from a very short distance.The Caterpillar Cement Mixer (36656) is an old item that we have produced for years, and has complied with all the regulatory requirements. There are many similar items on the market with a long transmission wires.  This is the first time we’ve heard such a complaint--a child wrapping the cord around his neck until it caused discomfort.Considering the weight of vehicle and controller are 598g and 118g respectively—relatively light—and the transmission wire is 3.5mm in diameter, we do not believe the toy is a hazard. We would like to treat this issue as an individual case since we’ve only received one complaint of this nature.",,

She knows it was at least six months ago. 08/30/2014 While at her home, the consumer’s seven year-old grandson was playing with the kazoo toy. He was being supervised by the consumer and other family members. Moments later, the grandson is gasping for air as he accidentally swallowed the toy’s mouthpiece that had suddenly come off while he was blowing into it. The child’s mother, a medical assistant, attempted the Heimlich maneuver but the toy piece would not come out. She tried to extract the part of the toy that was stuck in his throat but was unsuccessful at it as it was unreachable. They determined he had swallowed it and would hopefully expulse it in his bowel movements. The consumer states that they did not notice any bleeding during the incident and that the child did not complain of any pain for the days that followed. The consumer says the incident lasted anywhere between one minute and one minute and a half. For the next several days, the child’s bowel movements were inspected to see if the mouthpiece was there but they did not find it. He then started school and so the family could no longer inspect his bowel movements. They hope he got rid of it in some time during his school hours. Prior to the incident, the consumer noted that the mouthpiece had dimensions of approximately ½ inch by ¾ inch.   09/17/2014 The consumer hand-delivered a letter to the retailer recalling the incident that happened a few weeks earlier involving her grandson and how, because of this, it is an unsafe toy for children. 09/19/2014 The consumer received a phone call from [REDACTED] at Ja-Ru, Inc.  The consumer specified that [REDACTED] wanted to verify the toy’s copyright year. The consumer asked [REDACTED] what was inside of the toy’s mouthpiece and [REDACTED] assured her that it was only paper. Although this is what she was told, the consumer is uncertain of this because she did not see the inside of the mouthpiece herself. She hopes that [REDACTED] gave her accurate information.9/22/204 The consumer received a copy of a letter from Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc, indicating that they were the third party administrator on behalf of the retailer. The contents of the letter included the claim number, date of incident, the retailer’s account number, and other information the consumer could not recall at the time of filing her report.The consumer feels that this kazoo toy can become a choking hazard to children if the mouthpiece unexpectedly comes off.

When I cut the elastic string, it snapped so hard, it left welt marks on both of my thighs, through pants. At this point, I put the toy in a place no children would get to it and tried to call the company, but they were closed. Obviously, the tension in the elastic string is too great to have the consumer be responsible for assembling the bow and arrow.

There was a terrible smell in the car too and looking around to find the problem I saw a small hole being melted in the back side vinyl cover on the driver's seat. I quickly snuffed out the area with my thumb and the melting of the vinyl and smoke stopped. My first thought was there was some type of amber in the air which caught accidently on the car seat cover. Seconds later we started coughing again and I noticed another small hole melting into the vinyl cover and the area was illuminated by some type of light reflection. I snuffed out the area again with my thumb and started removing my granddaughter from the car seat when I noticed again another illumination on the seat cover and followed this source to a mirror on a Fisher-Price Hand Held Purse-Type Toy. Product number on the toy’s tag says R6796 and 24L4483. Product is made in China. Content of the purse says it contains a polyester fiber batting and cellophane. Product Description: It is a look-alike purse toy but not actually a purse. It has a white plastic handle with two colorful disks attached on the handle for a baby to move about. The toy has three cloths leafs attached to the handle that the baby flips about to look at various cloth imprinted pictures on each leaf side. The first leaf's underside has a round bendable reflective mirror.What I found was that the toy's mirror was reflecting the sun's rays against the back of the driver's seat. The sun was high and bright yesterday when the incident happened and the melting of the vinyl material on the car seat was immediate each time.Damage to my vehicle's car seat was minor and my granddaughter and I are fine. However, had I been traveling down the road I would not have been able to react so quickly to this situation. It is very fortunate my granddaughter was not injured by the mirror's intense reflection of the sun's rays on her or that we did become overcome by the melting of the seat's vinyl covers while driving!",Chambersburg,Pennsylvania,,Other Public Property/Office,"Incident, No Injury",Male,Unspecified,,,,,,,,,,,,

We certainly understand your concern and want to assure you our batteries are extensively evaluated for safety and manufactured under strict quality controls. In fact, out of the hundreds of millions of batteries manufactured every year, Duracell receives few reports of this nature. We have reached out to the consumer but are unable to get the device and batteries for analysis.  Without examining both the batteries and the device, it’s difficult to know what could have caused the problem in this particular instance.  That said, our testing has shown that certain events may lead to batteries becoming hot, such as external shorting of the battery.  Another possible cause is incorrect placement of the batteries within the device. Inserting the batteries backwards can cause the batteries to form a negative discharge, again resulting in leakage, overheating or rupture. Evaluating the batteries and the device is the best way to understand the problem.  It’s important for us to be aware of any negative experiences with our products, so we thank you for reporting your concerns.Again, we regret you had this experience.

I was impaled with his light saber sword into the left side of my soft palate missing my larynx by milliliters! There was immediate bleeding and I had to be taken to my dentist office for emergency treatment. As there was a tear in the soft palette there was nothing to stitch to, and I was placed on antibiotics and prescribed a numbing mouthwash. My dentist did take pictures of the affected area and said if it had been just a little closer, we would have been dealing with pharynx issues which would have been even more severe in nature.My husband and I were to leave in the next few days for vacation which we did, but I was unable to swallow anything that was not soft. Mainly, baby food, shakes, smoothies and cool soup. This is not particularly what I had planned for my vacation. It was not until the date of this letter that I have gone a complete day without pain in swallowing.I have alerted Hasbro Company regarding this incident and have not heard from them at this point and time.I truly hate to bring any type of toy issue to your attention as I know there are many that kids just adore and anything Star Wars is on the frontline, but under the circumstances I am concerned for injuries to children's eyes, mouths and ears. This sabre, once extended locks into place and does not retract. The toy number on it is CE C-3252 and a number below it43211.I hope that the commission can acquire the time to look into this matter and let's keep our children's safety as a main concern for everyone involved.Respectfully,[REDACTED][REDACTED][REDACTED]PS Milton Bradley sent a replacement Star Wars toy set to me for my grandson.",,North Carolina,,Unspecified,Injury - Seen by Medical Professional,Female,Self,60.0,,No,,,No,Yes,,No. Was requested by Hasbro.

Thank you for notifying NSI International, Inc. of this incident –Report  20161230-DEB93-2147408702.  NSI International, Inc. has sold over 4,000,000 patented Wubble Balls worldwide, with the WUBBLEX Ball and helium canister bundle introduced in 2015. This is the first report of a consumer “safety incident” received regarding the Wubble X Ball and helium canister bundle, and only the third inquiry at all regarding safety of Wubble Balls. Given the physical play of the product and the user base, we are certain you would agree that these are excellent statisticsAll our products are tested to and are in compliance with all applicable safety standards and are labeled in accordance to US regulations. In the case of Wubble X Ball Bubble Ball and helium canister bundle , the product complies to U.S.A. toy safety requirements of ASTM F963-11 and CPSIA and the labeling requirements of 16CFR 1500.130, 16CFR 1500.12.121(C), The Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulations and the Fair Practice Labeling Act.  Copies of all these reports have been supplied under separate cover to the CPSC.  The Wubble X helium canister is included with the Wubble X ball so that a supervising adult can perform single-use inflation of the Wubble X ball.  When the ball is fully inflated it is approximately 8 to 10” in diameter – which for reference is about the size of one standard inflated 10” latex balloon.The Wubble X helium canister is very clearly labeled (copy of packaging artwork has been supplied to CPSC under separate cover) in red font with the following waring statements: “Keep out of reach of children. Canister is to be used by supervising adult only! Do not use for any other purpose.” and “Do not inhale helium. Use only in a well ventilated area.  Never use in closed spaces. Helium reduces and can eliminate oxygen available for breathing and can cause rapid suffocation. Inhaling helium can result in serious personal injury of death.” Additional warning is given advising “Do not place nozzle in mouth or nose for any reason. Doing so can result in serious personal injury or death…”  In addition, the Wubble X Ball packaging clearly states the helium canister required to inflate the ball is “for adult use only”.The incident reported by the consumer occurred because the consumer failed to read and/or heed the clear instructions and warnings outlined here and provided on the product and neither did her 13-year-old daughter. The unsupervised teenager had to have access to, intentionally open by removing safety tabs and outer plastic shrink wrap, and then knowingly misuse the product in order to have a reaction to the helium contained in the canister. When appropriately used as directed in the very clear instructions supplied on the canister there is minimal chance of hazard or injury.NSI International regrets that the product was misused/mishandled by the consumer and that they ultimately denied themselves the truly fun experience of properly playing with the WubbleX anti-gravity Wubble ball.  We are relieved that the child sustained no actual injury and has recovered.. The report supplied to NSI International states that the consumer has not attempted to contact us but plans to do so. Again, NSI International, Inc. takes the safety of our products and our consumers seriously (We’re all concerned parents too!) and it is our goal to provide 100% safe products and consumer satisfaction.  NSI would welcome hearing directly from the consumer and we may be reached at the contact information supplied in the first paragraph of this response.",,

It consists of a squeeky button, a round orange rattle with tiny beads inside, a rounded tube with tiny beads.  The rattle when the pieces are turned makes a crank noise.  The main color is green, with other colors including pink, yellow and orange. I have 7 month old, the product was purchased for him.  He has only played with this toy a handful of times.  No other person has played with it.  The incident happened on Friday, January 25th.  I was holding him as my husband and I were skyping, and the rattle LITERALLY fell apart. It fell apart into 5 pieces.It was very strange, almost like the glue just stopped working. I'm glad I was holding him at the time and he did not have it in his crib or a carseat.  The alarming part is that inside of the rattle there are 3 cranks (that make the cranking noise when turned).  The cranks are connected by small screws and one of the cranks was EXTREMELY loose.  There are other small parts inside the toy that could easily come undone as the whole rattle itself did.

About 10 minutes after getting out of the bath, he said his ear hurt.  I own an otoscope since my children have frequent ear infections.  I expected to see signs of an ear infection.  Instead, I was shocked to see Squishy Baff inside of his right ear.  It looked like a crystal was in his ear.  Since it was 9pm, I put him to sleep and hoped it would dry out and fall out overnight.  He was still complaining in the morning so I took him to his pediatrician.  She confirmed it was in there and attempted to remove it.  My son was crying for the 10 minutes she tried to get it out.  She was unable to remove it and wanted us to see an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist right away.  Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get us in to see one until the next day.

He had to vacuum it out while my son continued to cry.  Luckily, he doesn't think there is any permanent damage.  I had to pay for 2 doctors as well as watch my son be in pain for 2 days and unable to hear out of that ear.  I'm not sure if my son had some on his finger and stuck his finger into his ear since it was wet or if he had some on his head and it went into his ear while I was washing his hair.  There are so many ways it could have easily gotten into his ear since it is for the BATH!  This product is UNSAFE and should not be used by children in a bathtub.  It turns to a gel like substance when wet since that's the whole point of it.  That makes it very difficult to remove from the ear because it falls apart if a dr. tries to grab it.

There is also an internal protection circuit to limit current in case of incorrect polarity between batteries.  If a damaged battery without proper insulation was forced into the compartment and the contact spring was also damaged and touched both the exposed + and – surfaces of the battery causing a short circuit there is a chance it might overheat.

Number stamped on box is 043210 86264WC,,7290012679612,,,amazon.com,,12/5/2012 ,Yes,"Edushape Ltd's Chubby EduBlocks are extremely unsafe for the young age group they are marketed toward, and I feel their current availability to children as young as 6 months needs to be swiftly addressed by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) before any children become ill or die after choking on or swallowing the foam that the blocks are made from. This is a seriously dangerous toy when used by the age group it is designed for!  The Edushape Ltd's Chubby EduBlocks are multi-color, larger-size, stacking foam blocks made in China that the manufacturer recommends as a safe toy for children 6 months and up.  We received the Chubby EduBlocks as a Christmas gift for my 17 month old daughter and we had this toy in our home for a little over a week and a half before she chewed off the tip of a block and ingested an undetermined amount of the smelly colored foam yesterday. This incident happened in less than 5 minutes, and occurred while I was in the room with her. She was sitting on the couch, playing with one red Chubby EduBlock, and I turned my back on her briefly to put a DVD on the TV for her.  While I put the movie on, she proceeded to chew off several pieces of varying sizes of the foam block tip before I understood what was occurring.  I have documented in a separate photograph the size of some of the red foam pieces I removed from her mouth and found scattered in her lap, but several of the chewed-off foam pieces were about half of an inch in length, certainly large enough for a younger child to choke on.  My daughter thankfully did not choke on the foam, but I believe she ingested one or several of the small foam pieces before I identified their source and was able to clear her mouth of foam and take the toy away from her. Generally speaking, we exercise much caution before introducing a new toy to our beloved baby, and this toy seemed to be safe enough at first glance since the blocks are soft and are marketed as both educational and non-toxic.  I trusted that ASTM safety standards had been considered and I also assumed that the foam had been tested during manufacturing and was strong enough not to crumble or break into bits in a child's hand or mouth.  In retrospect, I see I should have done more research before trusting my daughter with an Edushape toy, since many may recognize the Edushape Ltd. name as the same one that also distributed the 18,000 units of Mini Stars Building Sets that had to be recalled in July of 2011 because of similar choking hazards. I additionally have read that 40 units of Snap Beads distributed by Edushape in 2009 were also recalled by the Chinese manufacturer, Xiamen Xinlu Machinery Co., Ltd. I  see now that ANY young child with teeth can easily chew off and either choke on or ingest the foam tip from an Edushape Chubby EduBlock, and I am astounded that this product was ever considered safe by anyone in the industry in the first place!  ...Especially given this company's poor track record with recalled toys!  On top of the severe choking and ingestion hazard the foam poses, the blocks also have a distinctly chemical smell.  Exactly what chemicals are in this foam product now that my 25lb daughter is at work digesting them?  I recommend the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) investigate with serious scrutiny any and all materials data Edushape Ltd and their Chinese manufacturer can provide, because these blocks stink badly of chemicals, and they were ingested very quickly by my very young daughter.Yesterday after ingesting the foam, the rest of our day proceeded rather uneventfully, although I was aware that I needed to watch my daughter for any unusual symptoms should we require a trip to the ER.  She played normally during the day, and she went to bed fine at night, so I thought we were in the clear --- until she woke up screaming and crying at 10:30pm with extremely painful gas, which is an experience that is uncharacteristic of her.  After crying hysterically and shrieking in pain for about 20 minutes in my arms, she fell back to sleep and she slept for the rest of the duration of the night. She has yet to pass a stool, 24 hours now after ingesting the Edushape Ltd's Chubby EduBlock foam, but I tentatively think it will be unnecessary to have her examined by her pediatrician since she has been fine all day.  I do plan to keep a close watch on her for any further symptoms of intestinal and bowel obstruction, and will obviously have her cared for immediately if she has any issues.Please see to it that the safety of the Edushape Ltd's Chubby EduBlock is immediately reevaluated, and please also do it before any children die or require intestinal surgery from using this toy.  THIS IS AN EXTREMELY UNSAFE TOY, and after having had the experience of having my child ingest the foam, I believe another product recall may be necessary for Edushape Ltd.

My 4 year old daughter's left pinkie finger became trapped in the cylinder of the toy for 4-5 hours. We first tried using liquid soap, vegetable oil and ice water to remove it. Then, after over an hour when we were going to the emergency room my boyfriend notified his sister we were on the way to the ED which was just passed her house, and she suggested we stop by to see if her friend at the fire department could get it off. The chief came to her house and used a device the department often uses to remove rings that are stuck on fingers. It has a special gaurd that protects the finger while it cuts the top part. After another hour hswears some progress but was unsuccessful in freeing her finger. He then call it in so the department sent a crew in another fire truck with additional tools and man power. It took 4 fireman, pliers and cutting devices and another 2 hours to finally remove it. After it was removed we could see an inner ring on the cylinder that was causing the pain and cutting into her finger.  The finger was cleaned and bandaged with minor bleeding and significant swelling. 10 days later she still has a scab and red line around where the inner ring cut and trapped her finger. I have many pictures of the incident, as well as the toy but can't get them uploaded at this time.

We include warnings regarding small parts and button cell batteries both on the package and the instruction sheets (pictures attached) and meet all relevant CPSC and ASTM requirements.  This product has been tested by independent third party laboratories and passed all relevant tests.Spin Master has a very robust Quality Control and testing program.  We performed extensive abuse testing on over 9,000 units to see if we could replicate the complaint and found 0 failures of the battery door in those tests. Since this item was launched in 2018 we have sold over 1.1 million individual “pups” worldwide, and we have only received nine Customer Care communications (calls or emails) involving the battery door. This equates to 0.0008%.  At this time, based on the number of units on the market, the relatively limited number of similar complaints, the warnings we include on both the packaging and the User Guide, and independent and internal testing, we believe that the product meets or exceeds all applicable safety requirements and is safe to use.  Furthermore, because we are constantly looking to improve our products we plan to modify the nut and screw assembly to ensure the battery door is always screwed in securely, and we are increasing the screw hardness.",,

The product is a hard plastic shark with a very sharp, pointed  nose.  When used as it was designed, the toy is thrown into the water and the plastic shark glides through the water. It causes a serious hazard to other swimmers in to pool due to the very sharp point on the nose of the shark. In this incident my younger son age 11 threw the toy shark into the water as my older son was swimming on the other side of the pool. The plastic shark collided into my son's forehead causing a laceration and profuse bleeding that needed emergency first aid to stop the bleeding and immediate medical treatment to close the laceration with sutures.

The ears of toy have a spring inside the ear attached to a motor, as it sings the ears move up and down to cover its eyes. This is to simulate peek a boo. So he is learning how to grab stuff and basically grabs anything in front of him. As he was grabbing the right ear with his left hand, all of a sudden a piece of metal was protruding from the ear. I immediately took pictures of how it looked in that moment, then i cut open the ear to investigate and found a piece of hot glue on that specific piece of metal. Like someone knew it could fail and that was the solution.... I have videos as well as pictures, luckily my child was not injured but I am concerned someones will be. The metal is part of this spring design that extended up into the ear itself in a loop fashion, with the end of the metal being held in place by the spring itself. That end of the loop metal if pushed upward can pop out and then pierce the fabric of elephant with ease. The power of the motor pushing the spring around i believe also contributes.

We eventually transported our daughter to the ER but we were referred to the Fire Department due to excessive wait times (flu season).

We encourage our customers to provide additional information about incidents to our customer service department by email at custserv@nsi-int.com or by calling us at 888-425-9113.     Thank you for notifying NSI International, Inc. of this incident –Report  20190819-43BAD-1896758  NSI International, Inc. has sold over 20 million patented Wubble Balls worldwide since 2014, and 1,000,000 Water Wubble water balloon balls (introduced in 2016). This is only the second report of a consumer “safety incident” received regarding Water Wubble water balloon balls (and  note that the first inquiry was actually not related to the product itself) and only the fifth inquiry in six years regarding safety of Wubble brand balls. Given the physical play of the product and the user base, we are certain you would agree that these are excellent statistics.All our products are tested to and in compliance with all applicable U.S and international safety standards. Copies of all these reports have been supplied under separate cover to the CPSC.  All of NSI International’s products, when used as instructed, are safe, durable, and fun.  Water Wubbles are unique in that they both reusable and refillable but intended to be played with as one would play with traditional water balloons.  .No injury was reported by the consumer. The consumer’s claim extends from what appears to be misuse/abuse and unsupervised use of the product by her child. The child filled the Water Wubble to an overly large and unmanageable size and proceeded to overextend the filling valve to insert his hand into the Water Wubble. The consumer claims that (as used by her child) the ball presents a drowning hazard because “this ball got so heavy it weighed her son down.”  It should be noted that the Water Wubble material has a specific gravity far less than 1.0.  With a specific gravity of less than 1.00, a Water Wubble, filled to maximum capacity with water, and placed in a body of water will remain neutrally buoyant or float.  Since it cannot sink, it could not have weighed her son down. This premise is physically impossible. In addition, nowhere in the included instruction sheet is such play pattern recommended, suggested, or even implied. In fact, the instruction sheet for NSI’s Water Wubble product clearly states “We recommend filling to a size that is comfortable to hold in your hand”. Nowhere in NSI-sponsored marketing and advertising is the product shown being filled/handled by a user to a size larger than a baseball, nor does it show or encourage users to insert hands or other extremities into the ball.  It is also important to note that NSI cannot control the water safety skills and/or the physical dexterity of our users.  Nor can we control the parental common sense which must dictate proper supervision of children at play – particularly in swimming pools or other bodies of water.  Had the consumer thoroughly consulted the included instructions, they would have noted that the manner the child was playing with the toy was inappropriate. It cannot be stressed enough that supervising adults should always demonstrate proper use of a toy when introducing it to a child.The report supplied to NSI International states that the consumer has not contacted us but plans to do so. The consumer did reach out to NSI via telephone and has spoken with our consumer service department.The consumer was advised and instructed by our consumer service representative on the proper play pattern for Water Wubbles.To reiterate, it is paramount that parental common sense must dictate as to supervising children at play in their specific environments, be it outdoors or indoors.Again, NSI International, Inc. takes the safety of our products and our consumers seriously (We’re all concerned parents too!) and it is our goal to provide 100% safe products and consumer satisfaction.  NSI may be reached at the contact information supplied in the first paragraph of this response.",,

This resulted in an emergency room visit and daily doctor appts for 10+ days, including taking 6+ medicines for pain, steroids, and other eye drops.  I had to miss a full week of work and was limited to my bed for my eye to heal, as there was a severe risk due to the pressure of going permanently blind.  While my vision is back to normal, I run a high risk of glaucoma and have to get eye test twice a year for the rest of my life.My concern with this product is that Nerf implies safety.  If you look at the packaging and their marketing materials and commercials, the kids are having battles and are not wearing eye goggles.  the warnings are for choking only and a caution not to point at eyes or face.  Noting about recommending eye wear or promoting it in any way.In the past week, there is a report out of the UK, where they are now highlighting the dangers of nerf guns.  I have filed a report with Hasbro and their comments are they have been tested and are deemed safe as long as the guns are not modified or using non-branded nerf bullets.  This gun was not modified and we used the nerf elite bullets and sustained major injuries.Requesting the USPC to take action to require a change in how the nerf guns safety requirements are established from packaging to speed of the bullets.  I have spoken with Hasbro and other than taking down my information and sharing with their product team, they claim they are in compliance with the safety requirements and have no additional resources for me as the consumer to be an advocate in helping Hasbro make their products safer and to help reduce risk of others having the same injury.This week there was a report in the UK about 3 recent injuries that are similar to mine.  Action must be taken to protect our children.

This caused the wheels at the front of the trolley to lift up, and then the rear wheels to rapidly accelerate forward, bringing the front edge of the trolley rapidly up to his face, (driven by the increasing leverage his forward-falling weight was providing at the push bar) at the same time the push bar went all the way down to the ground, so that as the bar pulled him down, the front came up hard to meet him. The force was so strong that his four front teeth left an indentation in the wood, and even chipped away the wood at the very edge. This impact caused severe bleeding from all of this top teeth as well as both lips, and drove his second-from-the-front left tooth (right in front of the canine) all the way back up into his gums, impacting his forming adult tooth, and requiring him to go to the emergency room. He unfortunately had to have the tooth extracted as it likely would have gotten infected and further impingement would also damage his adult teeth. He opened the toy for Christmas and less than 24 hours later this incident occurred. This toy is made of a dense, inflexible wood, has a push bar located behind the rear wheels (rather than directly above or between the wheels), positions the rear wheels directly at the rear corner (such that the bottom of the trolley will not hit the floor to slow tipping) and incorporates no anti-tip features (such as lower features that extend rearward past the radius of the wheels).  When you apply even the slightest weight to the trolley (which you would expect given it is built for a toddler) the trolley tips backwards and drives the front end upward. It is a very dangerous toy and should not be made of wood, should incorporate anti-tip features, and/or should locate the push bar more directly above or between the wheels, not behind, to remove the dangerous leverage at the push bar. It was also noted during this 24 hour period that it has a fully-functional wooden vice incorporated, without any apparent safety features to mitigate the associated pinching/crushing hazard.  This also does not seem like an appropriate feature on a toy intended for 18 months plus. Tool sets we've seen in the past have safety features on their vices to prevent such injuries, and designs should account for multiple children (such as brothers) using the toy cooperatively which would remove the pain feedback to stop tightening the vice.",Unionville,Connecticut,06085,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Emergency Department Treatment Received,Male,My Child,3.0,Yes,No,,,No,No,Yes,We plan to contact the manufacturer and retailer as well with this information regarding this incident,,,

The purpose of the helicopter was to convince my grandson that was how “The Elf on the Shelf” Christmas story moved around after he went to sleep.  We never actually flew the helicopter until March of 2015.  In the initial charging phase per the directions the controller began to get hot and smoke.  I removed the batteries.  I was aware that it was out of warranty but felt I should contact your Customer Service because of the potential danger.  The lady I spoke with seemed very concerned and offered to send a replacement along with a shipping label to return the defective helicopter for a safety inspection.  I thought this was a very nice gesture.  After a couple of weeks I received the replacement, [REDACTED] Tactical Wireless Indoor Helicopter but no return shipping label.  Following the directions, I could not make this one operate.  I contacted your Customer Service again and spoke with the same representative.  She apologized and sent me another [REDACTED] Tactical Wireless Indoor Helicopter.  This one obliviously had been previously opened because certain packing parts and directions were missing.  Following the directions this did not work either.  I re-contacted your Customer Service and again spoke with the same person.  I explained that I had received two replacement helicopters and neither worked.  I also told her that I had not received the return shipping label.  She again offered to send another helicopter.  In all my conversations with your representative she was courteous and seemingly wanting to help me with my problem.When I received the last replacement it was not a helicopter.  It was a package of pieces and parts to a larger helicopter and a return shipping label.  At this point I became frustrated and decided to try and see if I could fix the original helicopter I purchased, the  BLACK SPIDER-XT Tactical Wireless Indoor Helicopter.  You will notice that the controller has been opened but I made no repairs.  I learned that the transistor was over heating causing the unit to smoke.  I did not have the skill to repair it.I am returning the original  BLACK SPIDER-XT Tactical Wireless Indoor Helicopter I purchased, the two helicopters, and the pieces and parts you have sent me.  I had not done this sooner because I have been in the hospital and recovering from a major surgery.I feel cheated by your company and I am also sending a copy of this letter to Walgreens.

This wireless helicopter uses the 27MHz band. Even without the RC controller even turned on, the helicopter would occasionally power on fully. For example: I was outside on a clear non-windy day and had turned the helicopter on and was setting it down on an outdoor table. As I was setting it down, it turned on full power and repeatedly hit my hand with the four rotors. The controller was not on and did not cause it to power on. This incident caused mildly painful bruising on several fingers and my wrist/palm.Another example: While flying the helicopter, according to directions, it would power on fully even though I was telling the controller to only use 1/4 to 1/2 power.

I'm a product designer myself, and I realize that no product should melt down under these very normal circumstances.  I opened the train and I can observe that the wires were not tied back and allowed to touch the heat dissipating surface of the PNP transistors.

Ugg!," Ref.: Report Id# 20120704-C93CD-2147466020There are 2 issues in the Report of the reference. One is related to the customer’s care and another is referred to the main incident described.1.	Ref customer’s care,Through this customer’s statements we can see his frustration and madness with his vendor. But when a vendor is not performing the way it suppose to, the consumer still has the chance to contact the labeler for support. This consumer had the chance to contact us for 7 months since he bought this product, but he didn’t. Please note we are strictly wholesalers and we are not responsible for any conduct, policy or care of a third party vendor or retailer. We regret to learn this vendor was not longer in business to attend this customer’s claim, but we always are here and welcoming anybody to contact us in order to solve any problem or question related with any of our products.2.	Ref the main incident,It is stated by this consumer in his Report, that the helicopter was broken (“broke a few parts”) and damaged as a consequence of a crash occurred 7 month ago.We can confirm that after testing this helicopter and letting several of them fall repeatedly for more than 2 feet, none of them were broken or damaged. To damage this helicopter it needs a really hard landing and higher altitude as said in the manual.It is clear that once the helicopter is damaged it can not be charged or used or powered up (and there is no sense on doing that). The manual of this helicopter states that once it is crashed and/or damaged the helicopter can not be charged or used, because only more damage can be caused (Page1: “Cautions….4……Regularly examine for damage….In the event of any damage, it must not be used until damage has been repaired. 5. Regularly examine for damage to the propeller, shell or the other parts. In the event of any damage or abnormal condition, it must not be used until the damage has been repaired”)It is also clearly stated that the consumer tried himself of repairing the crashed helicopter (“put on table to access damage..”) and that he was waiting for spare parts from his vendor. Once the helicopter is crashed, damaged and even tried to be fixed by unauthorized person, we are in this case in front of a total abnormal situation, and only can expect more damage to happen if kept trying to be used (as any single item in same situation).3.	Conclusion,A helicopter that has been crashed, broken and damaged can not be longer used. The further manipulation and/or use in this abnormal condition can only cause additional damage.We are totally confident that this product is totally safe and represents no hazard using it in normal conditions.",,

This was done through Amazon.com.  I was somewhat reluctant to do so as about 50% of the reviews were positive and 50% were negative, but the price was low enough that I was willing to take a chance.On May 28, 2011 we used the boat for the first time.  It ran fine for about 5 minutes and then the battery appeared to be losing power so we brought it into shore and took it out of the water.  While preparing the insert the second battery I had purchased, one of the rear propellers on the boat began to spin violently even through the remote control was off.  My son was handling the boat at this time.  I ran over, took the cover off, and turned off the boat, but the propeller continued to spin at a very high rate of speed.  At this point, the motor for the boat caught on fire.  I was able to reach into the boat and unplug the battery which stopped the propeller and appeared to stop the electical fire that had begun within the boat. This toy is marketed to 11 to 14 year old children.  If I had not been there to handle the situation, or if this had happened while the boat was unattended in the house, I am certain that the situation would have resulted in very serious consequences, including my 11 year old son getting injured or a house fire.

After close inspection of the wings after the crash, I noticed that the glue holding the wood wings together was applied very sparingly.  The balsa attached to the wing sheeting was literally falling off.  Forums describing the inadequate glue used to hold the plane together dates back to 2004.  7 years later, Hangar 9 still appears to not have fixed the problem.  I contact Horizon Hobby, the distributer and parent company of Hangar 9, and they dispute any problem with the plane.  At the minimum, consumers such as myself are out hundreds of dollars.  I lost over $500 from the crash.  At worst, the destruction of the wings in flight could cause serious injury.  I've told Hangar 9 of these problems and they appear to be doing nothing about it.

We purchased Siddeley (the spy plane from the “Cars 2” movie) from the Disney Store in the Rockvale Square Outlets in Lancaster, PA on Friday, August 26, 2011.  The following day, we unpackaged it and gave it to our 3 yr old son (soon to be four in November) to play with.  He is usually gentle with his toys, but every now and then, something may break or wheels may bend (like on a Matchbox Monster Truck because he presses down on it and drives it all over the place).  We were very disappointed when only a few minutes after giving it to him, the wheels of Siddeley broke off.  Our son is smart enough to know not to put something in his mouth.  He exclaimed his disappointment and asked his father to fix it.  My husband glued the wheels back on and allowed my son to play with it the following day (allowing the glue to dry for 24 hrs).  A different set of wheels broke off, only to get glued.  I just saw this plane (today is Thursday, September 08, 2011) on my counter with broken wheels laying next to it.  The body of the plane is die cast and is very sturdy.  It is alarming to us that these wheels continually break off.  I really hope something can be done to correct this situation.

After looking into this, we have found that if consumers do not follow the directions and turn the ESC switch to the “off”  position before plugging in the battery packs, in rare instances a voltage spike can damage the ESC and cause it to overheat.  To avoid a potential problem, it is important that users turn the switch to the “off” position each time before attaching battery connectors.  We have heard of very few instances of this happening, but we take any product performance or safety issue seriously so to avoid this concern altogether, an improved ESC has been developed and will be included with any future shipments of this vehicle.   We have also issued a technical bulletin that was sent to previous purchasers of this product to reinforce the instructions which say that they should turn the ESC switch to the “off” position before attaching battery connectors.Hobbico does not feel that this product does not pose an unreasonable risk of serious injury to the consumer.",,

And seeing this thing in action he never will.There is a kill switch on the base but it happened so fast you don’t even have time to think about it.This thing is extremely dangerous and should be removed from the market immediately.  You would be better off giving a child a BB gun at least that is predictable. Not this thing. The cage is flexible so whenever it hits something the cage bends and the propeller comes in contact with whatever it hits. In this case  it was my entire family. There is no way to turn it off unless you have the base immediately nearby without having come in contact with the propeller, you have to grab it in a way it’s unavoidable. Unless you leave it unattended to victimize your family to get the base.   If this had been a fraction of an inch over my child could have easily lost his eye. Contacted the company and they requested the item back for testing. In conversation I told them how extremely dangerous this thing is is.  They they referenced that they have helicopters that have totally exposed propellers and don't have issues with them as to which I responded as soon as you take your finger off the joystick they Stop!

This comment responds to CPSC identification #20131116-1A83B-2147449854.  We have reviewed the report of harm, the comment from the manufacturer. The E360 product at issue in the comment includes the helicopter, canopy, electronic speed control, servos, brushless motor and the main and tail blades.  Thunder Tiger, the manufacturer, does not include the necessary radio equipment (transmitter, receiver, etc.), nor do they include the LiPO battery and the charger necessary for remote operation of their helicopter.  The selection of these latter components is left to the complete discretion of the end-user.  Thus, the end-user has the responsibility to select and understand the operation of the radio equipment that he/she has selected for the operation of their radio controlled helicopter and to ensure that this helicopter is operated and flown in a manner that is safe and consistent with common practices of such equipment.  It appears from the context of the report provided to the CPSC that the user who made the report did not adjust the ESC (electronic speed control) as required by the manual, nor did the user read or understand the manual or the proper operation of the helicopter. We believe this because he states that “the electronic speed control powers up main motor with no input from transmitter” which is not true if he had followed the instructions on page 9 of the manual regarding the  ESC setting (see below).   Thus, it does not appear that the user had even successfully operated the E360 product prior to the incident.The manual itself provides a variety of relevant cautions and specific advice to prevent difficulties of the type experienced by the user.  A printed copy of the manual accompanies each helicopter.  The manual may also be found in a downloadable format at: http://manuals.hobbico.com/ttr/4717-a13-manual.pdf Of particular note, Page 9 of the manual includes relevant information that the user does not appear to have read:ESC Setting-Highlighted in gray with a large caution symbol: “To connect the Lipo battery pack to ESC is necessary at this step.  For safety please ensure the motor has been deactivated (or disengage the pinion gear from the main gear), and will not drive the main rotor before performing this step!”This section of the manual goes on to further explain the steps necessary to calibrate the ESC with the user’s transmitter.  Apparently, since the customer has reportedly been injured by this helicopter, he did not follow this precaution prior to connecting the battery to the ESC.  Referencing Page 2 of the manual: Caution- Point 3; second sentence: “Because flying a R/C helicopter is difficult, beginners must receive guidance and supervision from experienced pilots to minimize unexpected danger.”Flight Safety Checklist-Point 2- “Make sure all control surfaces are operated properly before flying.” Point 6- “The main rotor and tail rotor spin at very high RPM.  Make sure nothing can come in contacting with the rotor blades during flight.”Point 7- “ Always maintain a safe distance from the helicopter during flight.”Point 9- “Always operate and fly the helicopter in a safe and responsible manner.”Referencing Page 4 of the manual:Electric Device Connection-First paragraph, “The wire connection between devices and receiver may differ in different brand of radio system.  The figures below are for your reference. Please read your radio system manual to find the proper connections.”  On a side note, many radio manuals also include a warning statement pertaining to  turning the system on with the throttle in any position other than idle.  It does not appear that the user in question followed the necessary and proper procedures for using the product in a safe and recommended manner.",,

I didn't see what happened to make it come off, he just brought it to me in his hand. The coupler is a small part and severe choking hazard and we were so lucky that he didn't put it in his mouth. On inspection, it looks to me as though the washer that sits on the coupler spindle is not large enough to firmly hold the coupler in the rear slot of the train's plastic frame. My son must have somehow applied a sideways force to the coupler that made the coupler pop out of the frame. Neither the coupler or frame are broken.

During my initial setup of this product, the main blades unexpectedly spun up to a very high rate of speed without warning, despite the throttle stick on the included T8 transmitter being in the lowest position. I believed the power cut switch to be in the position to disable the blades; however, I later learned that was not the case due to the absence of labeling on the transmitter switches. This incident resulted in multiple lacerations to my arm that required medical attention and out of pocket expenses. I believe this incident was due to several serious safety deficiencies with this product:1. Inadequate Instructions: The included Quick Start Guide did not adequately emphasize crucial safety precautions, such as the need to remove the blades during setup. Notably, this Ready To Fly kit does not include the tools necessary to remove the blades. Additionally, the Quick Start Guide provided unclear information about the transmitter's controls and the function of each switch on the transmitter. I learned after the incident that the position of these switches is critical in order to maintain control of the helicopter and prevent the main blades from inadvertently spinning. 2. Inadequate Safety Warnings: The product did not include sufficient warnings about the potential hazards of having the T8 transmitter switches in incorrect positions. After the incident, I learned that certain switch positions could cause the helicopter to spool up to high speed regardless of the throttle stick's position - an outcome that would not likely be anticipated by an ordinary person. 3. Absence of Labeling on the Transmitter: Most of the T8 transmitter switches were not labeled at all, and the included diagram did not clearly explain their multiple positions and functions. This lack of labeling led me to incorrectly believe that the power cut switch was in the safe position, directly contributing to the unsafe situation.These shortcomings contributed directly to my injuries, and I believe the product is unsafe as currently designed. I have found indications on the internet through videos and product reviews where other users of this product have expressed concerns over the inadequate instructions and the absence of labeling on the transmitter. To prevent similar incidents from occurring, I urge the Consumer Product Safety Commission to investigate this product and require improvements, particularly to the instructions and transmitter labeling. Please let me know if any additional information is needed for this complaint.

The product is not marketed, promoted or sold as a toy for children. The Speks package bears the following warning label: WARNING: Keep Away From All Children! Do not put near or in nose or mouth. Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested.[REDACTED]The Get Speks website includes the following warnings: WARNING: Keep Away From All Children! Do not put near or in nose or mouth. Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested. Speks meet all toy and safety standards and are safe with proper use by anyone over the age of 14. their magnetic flux index rating is less than 50, however Speks should never be put near or in your nose or mouth.In a 2015 CPSC safety standard for high-powered magnets, CPSC determined the standard should not apply to magnets with a flux index of less than 50. Speks has a flux index less than 50 and, therefore, would not have been subject to the CPSC’s safety standard and would not have been classified as a hazardous magnet as defined by CPSC and ASTM standards. The CPSC magnet standard was overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit for reasons unrelated to the flux index provision. Speks magnets are safe when used by adults as intended.Because Speks magnets are not marketed, promoted or intended for children, it is inaccurate and misleading for the CPSC to place the product in the Product Category “Toys & Children.” I ask that the product be removed from this category.",,

Date: 2010Batch # IS-M11/019Link to product: http://mtcmans.com/Product/favors/lightup.htmlMy mom purchased some toy, light up glasses for the children (all over 3 years old) at Thanksgiving. They were a dollar store type item that would light up the way a lot of children's athletic shoes do. However, they run on three tiny batteries that are even smaller than the button batteries that children can accidentally ingest and die from!  I went into the kitchen after the kids had been playing with the glasses.  I saw a very tiny silver battery about the size of a pencil eraser on the floor.  Then I looked at the glasses my 8 year old son had been playing with and found a hole in the area where the batteries are supposed to be.  Immediately, the entire family was down on their hands and knees looking for more of them because we also had an infant and a tiny toddler boy in the house who most certainly have swallowed one of those dangerous batteries if they found it!We found the other two, thank goodness!  However, my husband and my brother-in-law who are both engineers looked at the other glasses the kids had and when my husband tried to access the batteries, the clip just popped out and the batteries went flying out all over the place.  Once again, sending everyone to the ground to find the tiny, dangerous batteries! Just one tiny bump to the battery door from a child can send these things flying out!What is worse is that they are not encapsulated permanently the way that batteries in kids shoes are OR the way that other, safer toys with these types of button batteries have a screw in the back to keep them from accidentally being accessed by a child and posing a serious threat.  These toys are too dangerous as is and need to be taken off the market ASAP!  All of these light up toys they make should be pulled off of the market until they can either permanently seal the battery area and make them a non-serviceable item like the light-up shoes OR install screws to prevent the battery door from just popping open.  This is not a case where the item is being misused.

Zoobles #227 Shellison GreenSpin Master was notified on August 9, 2012 of the incident from the CPSC which was filed by the mother of children which were using the product in question.  The mother did not contact Spin Master and did not plan on contacting us.  She did not seek medical attention from this incident.From all the information gathered, it appears that the product was abused by a child throwing the product onto a hard floor.  The product and its’ packaging are properly labeled with an over 4 year age grading and a Small Part Warning on the front panel of the package.  All packaging meets the ASTM F-963 requirements.  The product has been tested at an independent qualified third party lab which stands by their results.  The product was evaluated for the physical and chemical standards applicable to a children’s product as well an assessment for overall safety. We have uploaded the test reports specifically performed for this figure in the CPSC online system. The product has passed all testing.  This product in question is a figure that is a variant of our Zooble figure toy line which has been in distribution since Jan 2010.   During this almost three year period, the Zooble product has been a very popular product line and we have shipped over 30,000,000 individual figures.  The particular figure in this incident has shipped over 16,000 units.  Spin Master has never had prior claims of this nature.  Only two other claims have been reported of a person stepping on a Zooble and those reported that the product pinched their skin due to the opening and closing motion of the toy.  In both those incidents no skin was broken and there was no injury reported as a result.  In fact, Spin Master has had over 3,400 consumer calls related to Zoobles since Jan 2010, and these are the only incidents related to stepping on the product and being potentially hurt.   Upon hearing of this event taking place, our Call Center manager has contacted the consumer.  The consumer has never sought medical attention for the incident and has been very cooperative in agreeing to return the product in question.  It was explained to her that the abuse of throwing the product on the hard floor by the child likely caused the damage that apparently released the small parts.  She was thankful for the follow up by Spin Master and was most concerned that the small parts could pose a hazard to small children.  At this time, based on the number of units on the market, our call center contacts, independent testing assessment and reports, as well as our own production controls and auditing, we do not have any information that would indicate the product has any fundamental flaw that would create a hazard.  We believe that the product is appropriate for use and meets or exceeds all applicable safety requirements. The product from the consumer is currently in transit to be reviewed. We will further analyze it for any defects and make any further conclusions at that time.",,

While rare earth magnets with a flux index greater than 50 have been associated with perforations of internal organs when multiple magnets are swallowed, Retrospective Goods is unaware of any perforation of internal organs resulting from ingestion of Speks. This is to be expected because of the low flux index rating of Speks. Speks are marketed and promoted as a product for adults and are not marketed, promoted or sold as a toy for children.

While all the kids were outside playing together, my nephew again threw his angry bird, and it struck my five year old daughter in the upper lip, with the end of the beak, puncturing all the way thru the inside of her top lip.

I did notice initially that the dog had significantly less stuffing in in the body and arms and was very floppy in comparison to the duck. I see pictures of the dog on your web site and the one I purchased does not look like that in in comparison to the stuffing.  I thought maybe it was a cheaper version sold at Babies R Us in comparison to the one given to me that was purchased through Amazon.    My baby girl is five months old and could have died due to the leg of the dog becoming lodged down her throat in a matter of seconds. I did not know that the leg was small enough to fit into her mouth, but after the incident I noticed it is more pliable and was able to easily bend, fold, and stuff into smaller areas. I assume once baby vomit was put onto the leg it was able to go back even further into her mouth and lodge down her throat.  The entire leg of the dog was stuck down her throat and her air supply had been cut off!  She was vomiting but the leg was still lodged down her throat.She had this dog as comfort when she was first laid down in her crib and we usually took it away once she fell asleep.  I was in the room with her and took my eyes off her for a minute.  She is fine, but that was potentially very bad if I had not checked on her again when I did. I highly recommend everytone rethink the selling of the dog design as a product that is safe for infants. That or evaluate the manufacturer and make sure they are meeting your expectations.  I know freak accidents happen, but this product is not safe and is a choking hazard.  I believe it is a poor design and should not be offered as a comfort product for babies at all.  This product is even marketed as a aid to help you baby sleep, but it should not be.

He was rushed to the Dentist who after doing xrays determined that my sons top front 6 adult teeth were loose with the two front teeth getting temporary crowns on them. He has to go back to the dentist over the next 3-4 weeks to get repeat xrays and eventually end up with permanent crowns on his two front teeth. My son also went to an ENT surgeon who evaluated his nose and it was determined that the nose was fractured however it was not displaced severe enough to warrant surgery to correct it at this time, but possibly in the future. The rubber stopper on the bottom of the pogo stick was found to have worn off completely leaving only bare metal exposed on the tip of the stick.

Last night my 6 yr old son was playing with it. He popped the little bag of fingerprint dust and it exploded into his face. He immediately started screaming and crying because it went into his eyeballs. The powder when it gets wet, turns into a solid, gloppy substance that seems to multiply. I am not sure what this substance is but we literally had to pull it out of his eyeballs. It kept clumping up and appearing over and over again in his eyes even when we thought we had it all out. We literally had him get in the shower to let the water run in his eyes until I could find a medical eye wash kit to use. It took us over an hour to get this substance out of his eyes and to get him to settle down. I am concerned about the safety of this dust. The box indicates only a choking hazard for children under 3. My son appeared to be ok today, despite swollen, red skin around his eyes from crying and rubbing his eyes to get all of this substance out. He could have very easily scratched or injured his eyes and I consider us very lucky that things didn't turn out worse. I was very close to taking him to the local emergency room but I felt that it was probably better to keep trying to get it all out quickly so his eyes were not even more irritated than they already were. I do  not want this to happen to other children and that is why I am writing in to you.",Quakertown,Pennsylvania,18951,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional,Male,My Child,6.0,Yes,,,,,No,,," Five Below wants to thank the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) for its January 19th e-mail providing Five Below with an opportunity to comment on the CPSC’s draft Injury Report number 20120106-BF8AB-2147471601 prior to its publication on the CPSC’s Publicly Available Consumer Product Safety Information Database.This consumer did not directly contact Five Below (the importer of the Super Spy Kit).  As a result, we had no information on this incident prior to your e-mail.  We have contacted the consumer concerning this incident (as is Five Below’s general practice when a customer is not satisfied).  As of this date, however, we have not received any additional information from the consumer.At this time, we have no direct knowledge concerning this incident.  The consumer’s report states that the child “popped the little bag of ‘fingerprint dust,’ which released this material “into his face.”  They apparently washed fingerprint dust out of the child’s eyes, and the child reportedly had “swollen, red skin around his eyes from crying and rubbing his eyes to get all of this substance out.”  No professional medical attention was sought or needed. The fingerprinting dust in the Super Spy kit consists of common chalk (95% calcium carbonate and 5% calcium sulfate).  The product contains safe, well tested constituents and meets all applicable CPSC requirements.  In compliance with the CPSC regulations, an independent toxicologist previously reviewed the composition of the product (i.e., the fingerprint dust, in this case chalk).  The toxicologist was asked to determine if any component in the dust would pose, among other things, a particular eye irritation hazard or was considered as a skin or eye irritant warranting a warning or any other action.  The report from the toxicologist indicated that, either alone or in combination, the fingerprint dust constituents are not a skin or eye irritant for CPSC purposes.  This conclusion is supported by the material safety data sheets for the chalk used in the fingerprint dust in our product and is consistent with publicly available MSDSs for other chalk products.  We recognize, however, that placing anything, including small particles of chalk, into the eye can cause discomfort or reddening.In any event, this incident is the only claim of injury that Five Below is aware of concerning the Super Spy Kit’s fingerprint dust.  A dust brush and directions make it clear that the intended use of the product is to pour the fingerprint dust on the surface containing the fingerprints.  Numerous products are sold that contain “dust” or dust-like particles in small plastic bags.  This particular incident appears to be due to the method that the consumer used to open the bag and the proximity of the child’s eye to the mouth of the bag.  At this time, this incident appears to involve unique circumstances stemming from a failure to use the product properly.Five Below carefully reviews injury reports, as we have with this matter, to evaluate whether any actions or improvements are warranted.  We will continue to monitor and evaluate any reports relating to this product.  The information in this comment is true and accurate to the best of Five Below’s knowledge, information, and belief.",,

Over the Christmas holiday, she was given a doll by one of the staff members of the facility. When the consumer's sister showed the consumer the doll, the consumernoticed the right lower leg and foot was separated from the doll. Protruding from the leg of thedoll, about 2 inches, is a heavy metal wire. This wire is of no value to the lower leg and foot asit has nothing to connect to. The lower leg and foot is only connected by a STRING tied aroundthe MOLDED area of the dolls leg which holds the material from the upper leg in place to thelower leg. When this STRING comes undone, then the leg will falloff exposing the metalsticking out the end of the extremity.From observation all of the limbs of this doll are connected in this same manner.

We rushed her to the nearest hospital after reading the warning on the box they came in.  She vomitted a total of 12 times throughout the entire night.

We had to stay there overnight while we waited for the Dr. to use endoscopy to fish the balls out of her stomach.  One was caught in her esophogus, 12 were in her stomach. They stayed in her stomach for a total of 6 hours before she got treatment.  She had 2 Xrays 3 hours apart and the balls luckily stayed in her stomach without passing through to the intestines.   The first 2 Dr.s said that the balls would probably pass through her system, but as her mother I asked for a 3rd opinion. We found out that a 4 year old child had to have surgery a few days before our case at Kapi'olani Hospital because he swallowed 13 balls as well, but his parents took him into the hospital a week later after he complained of severe abdominal pain.  He had to be operated on because the balls did get stuck in his intestines and created holes that had to be sewn up by the Dr.  These balls are currently being sold in Hawaii as well.

The VTech Tote & Go Laptop has protection features to prevent battery overheating caused by incorrect polarity of a battery’s + and – contacts.  These features include a physical gap for the + contact that will not allow the – side to contact the wrong terminal. There is also an internal protection circuit to limit current in case of incorrect polarity between batteries.  If a damaged battery without proper insulation was forced into the compartment and the contact spring was also damaged and touched both the exposed + and – surfaces of the battery causing a short circuit there is a chance it might overheat.  However, if the product is used in the manner indicated in the instruction manual the batteries will not overheat.  2.	The instruction manual for the toy clearly states that new batteries should be used, the batteries should be inserted with the correct polarity and that the battery terminals are not to be short circuited. 3.

The consumer did not directly contact Five Below (the importer of the horn). As a result, we had no information on this incident prior to your email.    At this time, we have no direct knowledge concerning this incident.  The consumer’s report states that the child, two years eight months,  “had put the horn in her mouth while standing.  She was not running or jumping or horsing around. I was standing right next to her about to change her diaper. When she put the horn in her mouth, she screamed and there was blood dripping from her mouth.  I brought her to her pediatrician. My daughter now has a torn frenulum, bruising to the roof of her mouth, and also multiple abrasions/lacerations on the floor of her mouth.” We have already initiated an investigation of this incident.  The horn meets all applicable CPSC and ASTM F963-11 tests.  The product passed the tests for mouth actuated toys and toys with access edges and points.  These standards specifically address the risk of a sharp edge causing damage.   The product as designed should not have caused the reported incident.  We have no other reports of injury from this product line, and we will continue to monitor this product to ensure there is not unusual breakage occurring.   Our records do not indicate breakage of the mouthpiece.  Obviously, once the product is sold, we have no control over the product.    At this time, this particular incident appears to be due to the method that the consumer used it.  This incident appears to involve unique circumstances stemming from a failure to use the product properly.  Five Below carefully reviews injury reports, as we have with this matter, to evaluate whether any actions or improvements are warranted. We will continue to monitor and evaluate any reports relating to this product.  The information in this comment is true and accurate to the best of Five Below’s knowledge, information and belief.",,

He was super excited about it. On Wed June 13th 2012 I set it up for him on his bed- I followed the instructions step- by- step. I was a little concerned with how the strap that held the base of the tent in shape where the doors open up kind of just stuck up. I messed with the sheets a little to try to hold down this strap so my son wouldn’t get tangled up in it while getting in and out. Once I felt it was safely tucked away within the sheets I had my son start putting his stuffed animals in. He then proceeded to get in the tent with a handful of animals after setting them in there he got out to get more, but on his way out of the tent his foot ended up getting tangled in the strap and he flew forward and straight down on his arm. I had my back turned at the time but I was still in the room with him. I heard one of the most awful sounds in the world- the sound of my son’s bones breaking in half! As his arm hung there crooked within the skin we rushed him to the ER where they had to knock him out and straighten his arm and set it in a temporary cast. Needless to say, he broke both bones in his forearm Tomorrow, June 21 2012 we are hoping that it has begun healing so he can get his permanent cast.Just a week and a half ago my son learned how to ride his bike with no training wheels; it’s a beautiful summer and he is going to spend all of it in a cast. While I know there are worse things and it’s not the end of the world for him it still breaks my heart he has to go through this. To add insult to injury I have been trying daily since June 14th to get ahold of the makers (Idea Nuova ) of this Disney Pixar Cars bed tent and I have yet to get any reply to the company. I simply want to inform them of the injury their product caused my son but they apparently could care less. I don’t want this or anything worse to happen to anyone else’s kids. There are no warnings or anything on the packaging, there are no suggestions on how to hide the strap that holds the base together.

I can GUARANTEE that this will happen again to other children. Didn't they test this toy to see that it would last longer than1 hour before it becomes unsafe? Who is in charge of this testing? They are idiots. Having Disney's logo on it does not help. That tends to make you think of safe products. You do not need to have thousands of similar results to see that this toy will harm children.

She hadn't quite figured it out yet, and held the wand directly on her lips.  Generally, I helped her by holding it the correct distance away, but this time I let her try by herself.By the time lunch was ready she had bubble solution all over her lips.  My husband wiped it off, and we all sat down at the table to eat.  But before we even started to eat, my daughter started to scream, crying about cuts on her lips.  She grew more and more frantic, but other than her lips being more red than usual, we didn't notice anything.  She kept sobbing, and I was unable to comfort her until I offered she could lay down for a nap – which she rarely does.  Once she was sleeping I thought about the bubbles she had just played with, and wondered if they had irritated her lips.  I grew concerned, and carefully monitored her breathing while she slept.  Thankfully, the pain had decreased when she woke up from her nap, although they still bothered her.  Her lips appeared to have a chemical burn, and I started taking pictures.  As the day progressed they continued swelling until they were double their normal size.Over the next several days (which I continued to document with pictures) I was in touch with HealthLine, Poison Control, my doctor, and the company that sells the bubbles.  My doctor diagnosed a chemical burn, and requested I contact Health Canada.  I did, but never heard back from them.  The manufacturer company was very helpful, sending me toxicology reports and ingredient listings.  The bubble solution itself was made in China.  Everything appeared to be fine and  not dangerous, and I started thinking maybe my daughter had an allergic reaction, not a chemical burn.  And then I started researching the individual ingredients in the bubble solution.What I discovered what shocking.  This particular brand of bubbles contain two ingredients (glutaral and sodium hydroxide) that, although considered safe by the FDA in small amounts, can be very dangerous.  I found this on a webpage about sodium hydroxide, which is also used in oven cleaners:Skin contact with sodium hydroxide can cause severe burns with deep ulcerations.  Pain and irritation are evident within 3 minutes, but contact with dilute solutions may not cause symptoms for several hours.  (http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002487.htm).My daughter's lips are healed, but I will never let her blow bubbles on her own again.",Ebenezer,Saskatchewan,S0A 0T0,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Seen by Medical Professional,Female,My Child,2.0,,,,,,Yes,,"I was in touch with the manufacter's head office in the US shortly after the incident, but I have lost their email address."," Unique Industries, Inc., 4750 League Island Boulevard, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1222, 215-336-4300; doing business in Canada as Unique Party Favors, with a Canadian office located at 6170 Edwards Blvd, Mississauga, Ontario, L5T 2V7, Canada.Unique Quality Assurance, 4750 League Island Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19112-1222,  uniqueqa@favors.comReport # 20110506-FE714-2147479450Regarding this reported incident which occurred on or about May 11, 2009 (over 2 years ago) of a child under 3 years of age playing with Unique bubble solution and a wand, we provide the information below:As stated by the consumer, the child was under 3 years of age and was playing with the bubble solution and wand unattended to by an adult.  This contradicts the age-grade for this product.  The packaging provides the following statement: “Appropriate for children 3 years and over.”  The bubble solution products that Unique currently markets and sells are, essentially, soap and water.  Unique provided the consumer with ingredient details and a copy of a recent toxicological review and approval (TRA) report from a U.S. board certified toxicologist to assist her doctor in a medical evaluation.  The TRA report states that “one or more of the ingredients in this material could cause an allergic reaction in a few persons who may be sensitized to these substances.  Such an event, while expected to be rare, cannot be ruled out.”  This is a standard clause appearing in virtually every TRA report; it is intended to warn of the possibility that some people are hypersensitive to a certain ingredient, and it is often unknown to them until they come in contact with that ingredient.Unique has sold bubble solution in many countries for many years.  Unique has never received a report detailing this kind of reaction in relation to its bubble solution.  Further research regarding the two ingredients focused on by the consumer reveals that these ingredients are in very low concentration levels.  For a 4 oz bottle (118 ml, equivalent to 2365 drops per bottle):Glutaral concentration = 0.05%, 0.0020 oz/bottle, 0.0590 ml/bottle, which equates to less than 1/3 of a drop per 4 oz bottle.Sodium Hydroxide concentration = 0.75%, 0.03 oz/bottle, 0.885 ml/bottle, which equates to less than 4.5 drops per 4 oz bottle.Based upon the above information, the concentrations of these ingredients are extremely low; so low that it is, in our opinion, highly unlikely that they could cause a chemical burn.  If one or both of these ingredients were the cause of the reaction described, which is in our opinion inconsistent with the existing concentrations, it is more likely the result of an allergic reaction by someone with an extreme hypersensitivity to such ingredients. Unique’s recent passing tests by independent labs for bubble solution are summarized below:Testing Performed:                                                                              Date Performed:USP 51, Anti Microbial Degradation:                                                       04/28/11Lead (surface and substrate) CPSIA/16 CFR 1303/Illinois Lead law           01/31/11Phthalates – CA Prop 65/CPSIA                                                              01/31/11Flammability – 16 CFR 1500.43                                                             07/21/10TRA -Toxicological review of formulation to U.S. requirements                  06/02/10Hazardous Chemicals tests 16 CFR 1500.231                                         05/27/10Canadian Hazardous Products, Schedule 1, Part 8                                    05/27/10U.S./Canadian Toy safety testing FHSA/ASTM/CHPR/CPSIA/Phthalates        02/09/10In conclusion, we are still investigating this matter.  We have contacted the consumer to obtain and evaluate the specific product at issue.  However, as a general statement, these products have no known history of this kind of reaction.  These products are subject to a number of passing tests; and there is no indication that any of ingredients identified by the consumer, all of which are used regularly in the marketplace, are unsafe.

It is a clear type of ball that has a yellow thing in it to represent the yolk of the egg.  It feels sticky on the outside as well as squishy.  It is filled with multiple ingredients that combined are clear in sight.,Toys & Children,Toys,"Balls, Other or Not Specified (5016)",5016,JA-RU INC,Ja-Ru,5301,158040,7565605301,,,Dollar General,Indiana,5/15/2011 ,No,"On May 15, 2011, at approximately 8:50pm, my 9 year old daughter purchased an EGG SPLAT BALL manufactured by Ja-Ru, Inc., from a local Dollar General store in Indianapolis, Indiana for $1.00.  At approximately 9:40pm she opened up the product in the car.  While talking to her brother on my cell phone in her right hand, she was rolling the EGG SPLAT BALL in her left hand and it burst open right in her face, went in her mouth and she swallowed the contents.  I immediately told her to spit out what she could, ran around the car got her out and came in the house.  She immediately started complaing and crying that her throat was burning. I got the packaging out of the bag to see the ingredients and/or warnings so I would know exactly what I was dealing with, but there wasnt much there.  There were NO ingredients listed on the package, and the only warning was to not give to children under the age of 3.  I googled the product on my [REDACTED] and found the following ingredients:  Water / White Oil / Glycerol / Sebs / Phenoxyethanol / Diazolidinyl Urea / Bronopol / Color / Sodium Laureth Sulphate.  The only web site I could find the ingredients listed was from this very same site that I am posting this on now from a person that had a child that had basically the same thing happen except it went in to their childs eyes, and they suffered greatly from it.  I called the Poison Control Center instantly.  As I was reading off the ingredients, they informed me that they were very aware of the ingredients of this particular toy - which led me to great concern.  They told us to have her take small drinks of water, which we had already done.  They then stated that they would call back a little later to check on her symptoms.  When they called, her throat was still burning, and she was still coughing a very deep cough, almost like a cough when you have bronchitis.  They then instructed me to take her to the nearest ER and they were going to call the Hospital ahead and let them know to be expecting us.  On the ride there the coughig, burning continued as well as vomiting.  We made it to the hospital in approximately 10 minutes, and she was taken almost immediately.  They took her vitals, and because they were somewhat normal they didnt seem as much as a hurry as they were when we first arrived.  All rooms were full, so we didnt get in to a room until about an hour later.  Once we finally got in to a room, she wasnt seen by anyone until about another hour later (which is another complete story in itself...).  Anyhow, after a very long time my daughter eventually fell asleep.  THEN the doctors of course decide to start coming in.  They said that since her coughing had subsided they were going to release us, and gave her some milk to drink.  Of course, the second they woke her, she started coughing again. - nothing had changed - So..we were released anyhow with instructions of further things to watch for.  One being if her coughing or burning did not stop within 24 hours to follow up with her pediatrician immediately.  Well, 24 is up at this very moment, and the symptoms have not went away, and her cough is sounding worse, so she will be seeing her pediatrician first thing in the morning.  I do not know at this point what will happen next, but my daughter said this, All I know is that when I have kids they will NOT have toys like this, and neither will my grandchildren!  I dont know all the details of every ingredient, but the ones I do know, should not be in childrens toys.  This toy was supposedly made to be able to throw and stick on windows and things.  If it bursts from a 9 year old child just rolling it around in her hand then there must be some serious defects in the production of this item and it should be recalled immediately to eliminate further innocent children from being seriously injured!!

It seemed that the spring was broken and the normally spring loaded shaft was no longer spring loaded, it just slid in and out without any resistance. She stopped playing with it and a few minutes later her 5 year old sister picked it up to show me that it wasn’t working. When she set the end of the pogo on the ground the spring suddenly released causing the handle to slam into her chin. This scuffed her chin, split her lip and knocked one tooth out. It also knocked another tooth back at a 45 degree angle in her mouth and bruised her gums. This resulted in a great deal of pain for my daughter, heartache for my wife and I and an emergency trip to the dentist.

This item was purchased in 2003 and has been enjoyed by my family periodically since then with minimal trouble. Replacement (due to recall) of original drum sticks was done and necessary, as the old ones broke at the tips (presenting a hazard). Recently, my 3 year old daughter was using one of the drum sticks on the Ladybug xylophone, which is a common way of playing the xylophone in my home (instead of the mallet that was included, but I removed because it looked like a lollipop to my little ones and they kept putting it in their mouths). She came to me in shock, showing me small pieces that had come from it. The plastic peg that holds the metal sound making disc to the ladybug had broken and become disconnected, resulting in 2 small plastic pieces, one of which is sharp, and the small metal disc. I have not had luck in contacting the number on the product, so I checked on the internet, called Battat at 800-247-6144 and through creative button pushing to reach a human (luck) and persistence was able to speak with a human. After leaving 2 voicemail messages and a written message to [REDACTED] from a co-worker named [REDACTED], I eventually received a return call 2 days later from [REDACTED](sp?) who informed me that she had no recourse but to give the information to the president of Battat and his secretary because they no longer had a working relationship with Parents Magazine (since 2010 from what she said). Hence, according to her, there is no way to report the incident. Unsatisfied with the response from Battat (who were listed on the tag on the toy as being responsible for the design and manufacturing of the toy), I began to seek out Parent Magazine. After lots of searching and several phone calls, I was connected to [REDACTED] yesterday and I was able to leave her a voicemail. She returned my call this morning around 10am (Indiana time). I explained the incident and the difficulty I experienced with Battat. I was expecting to hear from her again today. Her number is: [REDACTED]. It is now after 5pm and I am concerned that this matter is not being handled in a way that will bring about safety for the more than 300,000 children who are currently being exposed to the hazard of this toy. I have come to learn that the ladybug xylophone has not been included in these sets for the last 3 years. Perhaps they knew something that I am only discovering now?I look forward to your reply and would happily participate in any way in the future to bring out the airing of the hazard of this toy, so that no one will be harmed by it, or to bring justice for those that may already have been harmed.",West Lafayette,Indiana,47906,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,My Child,3.0,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,I've still got the product and would be happy to share it if necessary.

We immediately flushed her eyes with copious amounts of water until the burning subsided. On Monday morning 9/26/11, we took our daughter to her pediatrician, who then referred her to an opthalmologist. My daughter had a chemical burn to her right eye. Fortunately, we did an excellent job rinsing the eye (according to the ophthalmologist). She was prescribed eyedrops to help the burn to heal and scheduled for a follow up appointment.After this incident, I went online to see if there had been any more reports of this kind. On the Target website, there is a post warning about the swords, but they are still on the shelf. Fortunately, in that post no one was hurt; damage was done to the car.

Because the customer chose not to release their contact information to K&M, we have been unable to obtain any additional information regarding the incident described in the Report.  It is unclear to K&M how the described injury occurred because, in addition to fabric surrounding the metal inside the bracelet, there was also a PVC sleeve around the metal.  Even if all the fabric were removed from the bracelet, the PVC sleeve that encapsulates the metal strip would prevent any contact with the metal, thereby preventing any injury.  If the reporting individual, or any customer, would like to discuss an experience with this or any other K&M product, please contact our customer service department at 1-800-800-9678.We have confirmed that the product at issue underwent rigorous third-party testing prior to marketing.  According to a December 8, 2009 Test Report, the product passed all applicable requirements and specifications, including regulations for accessible sharp edges, materials and warnings.  Despite the favorable third-party testing results, K&M has since continued to voluntarily improve the safety and quality of the product above and beyond legal requirements.  Specifically, K&M has recently added a layer of tape that encompasses the edges of the metal inside the bracelet, has thickened and widened this PVC sleeve material that serves as a further barrier to contact with the metal and added the following warning: “If Fabric Tears Please Discard.”Please be assured that K&M International, Inc. is committed to providing safe and high-quality products to our customers.",,

I have posted a photo of the key faults here:http://vato.org/photos/misc/3007952_Faulty_Arena_Lamp.jpgThe brown wire is live at mains voltage.  The mains are not secured to the enclosure so the wires' solder connections are subject to physical stress as the power cable is moved outside the enclosure.  This likely led to the brown wire breaking at its solder joint on the inside of the on/off switch, which is visible on at the top right of the picture.  This left the live wire floating inside the metal enclosure with no harness to prevent it from contacting the enclosure or other components.To demonstrate the point, I nudged the wire around and it indeed contacted other components causing a very large arc.  The device does have a fuse, which blew.  Given the shoddy construction though it is reasonably likely that the fuse will be rendered in operable by a similar mechanical failure.  This could lead to shocks, fire, etc. and clearly does not meet even common sense safety standards much less government or industry normal standards.

Within less than an hour, our 20 month old managed to get some of the stickers off the puzzle pieces (I didn't even know they were stickers- they look just like painted wood). I removed these pieces from her. However, a few days later, she was able to bite a small piece of one of the other puzzle pieces off, and was gagging on it. Luckily my husband was able to dislodge the piece from her throat, but that's scary. I don't feel this item is safe for children anywhere near age 2. I also don't think this product is of solid wood construction, as advertised on the back.

We take all of our customer’s feedback and experience with our product seriously and sincerely apologize that we never saw your email otherwise we surely would have immediately contacted you. Firstly, we apologize that you had any trouble at all with one of our products. We are very concerned to determine how this could have happened.The box your Light Up Ducks came in has a note on the bottom to save the packaging for information printed on it. If you kept this packaging, there is a tracking number printed that allows us to match your item to a specific shipment so we can look even further into this. If you would be willing to provide this information to us, that would be wonderful.We have reviewed our testing history for this item and want to ensure you that we have a steady passing testing history with an approved CPSC laboratory in compliance with CPSIA regulations. All of our products, including our Light Up Ducks, continually meet or exceed safety and standard regulations and are regularly tested formally in the lab and spot tested in house. Without knowing the tracking number of the batch you may have purchased from, I pulled a few randomly from the stock we currently have in our warehouse. I found that the samples I pulled all had tight seals on the bottom, making it virtually impossible for me to pry or otherwise pull the bottom plug out to expose the electronic pieces. Upon cutting the plugs out that contain the electronic pieces to light up the ducks, I see that they are three tiered and sealed flush against the exterior, making a smooth, thinly seamed seal. The plug itself it also glued at two different tiers internally to prevent movement. In combination with our testing history, product review and not having had any other reports of any type of issue for this product, it appears as though this is an isolated occurrence. We are very sorry that this incident occurred in a product you purchased. On behalf of Elegant Baby, I sincerely apologize that you have received a bad product from our line. I will be following up directly with you following this response to discuss a replacement piece for the damaged item.",,

I wasn’t so worried about it because we have had it for a while BUT the metal piece that held the handle in place is beyond dangerous/deadly for a small child/toddler if they were to be stabbed or fall or this metal point. I have 3 pictures to send you if you are interested in this. If my son was playing with this outside the tub & the handle fell off he would have come running to me to let me know something broke & if he would have tripped & this long metal piece punctured him he would have been severely hurt & im not even going to say what would have happened if it punctured his chest area. As a mother I am very upset how this product was designed for a child to play with & I am so happy that the handle came/broke off when I was turning it. I contacted Crayola by email on Tuesday & I have heard nothing about this incident so I figured they don’t care about childrens safety so it was time to let you know what was going on.

Then we have to take the mask off because it seems hard to breath. We plan to air it out for a few weeks prior to trick-or-treat, we hope the fumes will subside by then.  The mask is unwearable now.

My granddaughter was in the backseat buckled in her car seat. She was playing with a glow stick she had received at a family fun day event. She said uh oh. I turned around immediately to see what the problem was. She had broken the glow stick and a shinyglowish substance came out of it. Before I could pull over and get to her--she had rubbed her eyes. I grabbed a bottle of water I had in my car and began rinsing her eyes the best I could. I called 911 for the poison control number. I called them--they told me to run cold water over her eyes for 15 minutes. I was only about 1/2 mile from her other grandmothers. I took her in and ran water the best I could trying to hold down a screaming 2 year old that was in pain---not an easy task. Her eyes remained very irritated for a couple of hours. There was no identification on the glow stick & I had a very difficult time finding which station that had given them out. I just found out it was the Asthma foundation. They had given them out in bags with candy & info. After quite a bit of researching--they found out they had gotten them from Oriental Trading Co. I went on the web site but couldn't find any that looked like them. I work for Human Services and did not think much about her having it because she is very smart and I had told her not to put it in her mouth--she did not. My concern it that how many other little ones out there could have the same thing happen--especially families that are not as cautious me. I work with families that do not supervise their children much at all. The other concern I have is that there was no way to trace these----I have tried for weeks.

He had been vomiting for a few days, when I noticed some blood in his vomit.  I immediately took him to Robert Wood Johnson Hospital in New Brunswick, NJ on December 11, 2011.  He was lifeless, and initially doctors were talking about the possibility of polio.  Once he was given an IV, he regained some energy.  At this point, they sent him for an x-ray on his abdomen.  The x-ray had shown a ring formation of sorts.  At first, several of us thought he swallowed a piece of jewelry.  Thankfully, the doctors admitted him to the hospital.  We thought that this was something that would just pass in the bowels.  However, the next day's x-ray showed no movement of the 'ring'.  Moreover, the image of this x-ray clearly showed the Buckyballs, and I was able to identify them and tell the doctors these were strong little magnetic balls.Doctors operated on [REDACTED] on December 13, 2011.  There were a total of 9 magnets that he had swallowed.  There were some in his stomach, and magnets in two different areas in the small intestines.

This incident is no different, as we have thoroughly reviewed both the incident and the product.  To our knowledge, no other such incidents have been brought to our attention concerning the product.This product and packaging were reviewed, tested and assessed for children ages 4 and up. The product packaging and instructions are marked clearly with suitable warnings, instructions and an appropriate age grading, and independent lab testing confirmed that the product was in conformity with applicable standards. For example, the instructions provided with the product contain a separate “Safety Instructions” section with 8 main safety points for the adult to be aware of, including that the doll must be held at arm’s length and in an upright position in order for it to launch properly and avoid injury.  Both these safety points and the safety points repeated within the step-by-step instructions are supplemented by images to advise on how to properly use the product: (1) an image of a child holding it correctly with a “check mark” next to the image, and (2) an image of a child holding it incorrectly with an “X” over the image.  Finally, the product is clearly labeled “Adult Supervision Recommended” as each child’s abilities will vary based on maturity level.  This incident reiterates the importance of maintaining adult supervision and ensuring proper interaction by children with our products. As noted above, we investigate all incidents as safety is paramount.  If appropriate, we incorporate any needed changes to the product or instructions for future production.  JAKKS is committed to continuous learning and growth while making high quality and innovative toys, games, entertainment and lifestyle products.

First, the puppet theater has a tension rod that is supposed to hold it in place in a doorway. The puppet theater is made of fabric that hangs in the doorway. The tension rod does not work causing the theater to slip and fall.  Second, there is a very heavy metal rod that fits in the middle of the fabric panel and is used to slide the curtains open and closed. It is not permanently fixed to the panel.  The rod is too long for the tiny fabric pockets that it sits in and falls out very easily, especially given the faulty tension rod (I replaced it with my own tension rod).  Thirdly, the rod is incredibly heavy. Way heavier than it should ever be. It must weigh about a half a pound or a pound. If it should fall onto a child's head it would cause a devastating injury. Seeing as though it falls out easily because a) the tension rod does not work and b) the rod does not fit in the pockets that secure it, I can imagine that this could happen very easily. It fell out while I was trying to install it 3 or 4 times until I finally decided that for safety reasons I was going to remove the rod and buy a wooden dowel to replace it.

If the Dog poops on your turn  you scoop up the poop with your showel. Three poops and you win. Kids love silly things and I thought it would get a lot of laughs. First it was very hard to make it work and you have to dig the Poop out if the exact amount of treat was not fed to the dog. This teaches kids to stick things up their butt. But beyond that, my 6 1/2 year old granddaughter put her ring finger into the back end of the dog because as always it was not working as claimed. HER FINGER GOT STUCK ALL THE WAY IN. I am an RN. I tried oil with gentle massage. When that did not work, I wrapped her hand in an ice cloth to keep swelling down. I PULLED THE DOG APART ONLY TO FIND THAT THE INNER TUBE WHERE HER FINGER WAS STUCK WAS A SOLID TUBE.  Because I could not see the color of her finger inside, I started calling my husband who was 5 minutes from home to get home to take us to the ER. By this time my granddaughter was hysterical. Luckily, at this point she was able to get her finger out. There was a large indent on her finger showing me the degree to which her finger was stuck.

She was pushing a My Sweet Love Baby Doll Stroller.  As she was walking / pushing the stroller, she tripped and fell onto a part of the stroller that had a slightly protruding semi-dull flat metal joint approximately 1 inch in length (about half way up the stroller that is approximately 2 feet in height when extended).  She hit the metal part with enough force while falling that it caused a 1 inch laceration between her nose and right eye near her eyebrow, just missing her eye.  We immediately took her to the ER at a local hospital in Sugarland, TX.  Once she was taken back to a room, the ER doctor examined her and said she would need stitches.  Due to her anxiety and fear, and his concern that she would be moving during the procedure, he decided to put her under general anesthesia (in our case, the drug ketamine) which of course has risks.  He put in 6 stitches and observed her until approximately 2:30am March 12, 2013.  The entire duration from the time of the incident to when we returned from the ER was over 8 hours and very traumatic for our little girl.Safety concern:My concern is that this will happen to other toddlers and could result in a more significant injury (e.g. losing an eye or even death if the metal object were to strike a major vein such as the jugular vein).  Additionally, there is no warning/cautionary statement on the packaging, nor is the age limit displayed prominently on the packaging (I did not see the age limit until inspecting the packaging for over 15 minutes - the age limit is in a flower graphic at the top of the packaging - instead, it should be clearly displayed more predominately and explicitly written: For age groups 2 years and older).

These gyros have a two-ring metal frame that is split for assembly and adjustment of the gyro and, later, these ends are butt together (from the manufacturer's description).  What I did not realize in handling the gyros is that there are sharp edges in these butting ends and in junctions of the frame with the spinning axis of the rotor plate of the gyro.  Some of the edges are sharp enough to cut skin deep enough to produce a light bleeding.  Fortunately, it was my hand, and not my daughter's, that got cut.   I remembered tonight I had received an e-mail invitation from the Marbles store to post of a review on their site of my purchase of the Twin Gyros set, so I submitted a negative review warning potential buyers of what had happened to my hand.  I have also e-mailed the store advising them of the review (and attaching a copy of it in case a website editor decided to trash it).  I checked on the web and there are too many stores that sell these gyroscopes from Tedco for me to be warning all the stores to check the gyros they sell.  It is more effective and practical to notify you.  I have chosen not to return to the store the Twin Gyros set I bought in case you wish to examine them, and I would be glad to send to you if needed.  I am a medical doctor and would be unethical not to try to avoid a child getting hurt by these (otherwise nice) toys.

The customer wrote back on Saturday, May 4, 2013, explaining in more detail and with pictures. Kid O responded on Monday, May 6, 2013, explaining that we take this incident very seriously and we had spoken to our factory & design team, forwarding them these pictures. The factory was able to confirm that this pen was from our first production batch in 2011. We also confirmed with our factory that additional screws and glue were added to the Magnatab Pens' design in early 2012 to avoid any potential quality issues. We have not had this production batch in our warehouse for almost two years. Taking precautionary measurements, we had our warehouse double check all remaining inventory to make sure no products with that batch number remain in stock. We then in the same email offered the customer a replacement Magnatab or other Kid O product of their choosing. On Thursday, May 9, 2013, the customer responded that she would like to receive our Cursive Uppercase Magnatab as a replacement, as she likes our products and also offered a suggestion as to help keep the magnet in the pen. On Friday, May 10, 2013, we thanked her for her email, reiterated that we are confident that this will not happen on her replacement Magnatab, and confirmed that the replacement would be received the following week.

1886,20150407-A00AD-1477811,4/7/2015 ,5/4/2015 ,5/18/2015 ,Consumer,Metal alcohol burners,Toys & Children,Toys,Chemistry Sets or Science Kits (1393),1393,C & A Scientific Co.,Prmier,97-5320,,,,,(Amazon.com) Medix Corp,California,3/3/2015 ,No,"The information below was taken from an email sent to the CPSC Information Center:The consumer believes that his alcohol burners present the same exact problem as the ones in Recall# 06-061.The consumer has 50 unsafe wick-less metal alcohol burners (used in scientific experiments).Description: The metal alcohol burner consists of a stainless steel tank with a screw-on steel lid. A copper tubing wick in the shape of a loop is soldered on the top of the burner's lid. The burner and lid measure 3-inches in diameter by 3 ½-inches high. The burner also has a separate metal top which fits over the copper wick to act as a snuffer, and a metal heat shield designed to sit on top of the lid. It has a rubber keeper to prevent vaporization of alcohol. The item number 97-5320 is printed on the burner's packaging. The possible name of the manufacture is “Premier” located in China (see photo of shipping container).  The shipping container has this information on it also: C.A PO. No.P182 BALTIMOR C/NO. MADE IN CHINA.  A possible injury or property damage can occur due to flammable alcohol leaking from the holes located in the copper tubing on the upper coil portion of the burner. The holes are in a placement where the rubber keeper/stopper cannot prevent fuel from leaking out when tipped over or when the internal temperature of the fuel tank rises and forces fuel to rise upward through the copper tubes leading to the coil on the surface of the burner. (See photo of hole not being covered by rubber keeper/stopper) I have inspected 10 out of the 50 received and all have the same hole placement. (see photo of hole in relation to rubber keeper/stopper).  On or about March 21 is when I observed the alcohol leaking from the holes in the copper coil. At that time I notified the retailer of the problem. Their response was: “as to the product recall, we checked with the manufacturer and that was for a previous model, not this one”. Dated: March 23, 2015 On or about March 21, is when I searched the internet for information regarding this type of burner to see if anyone had experienced the fuel leakage problem. That is when I discovered there was a recall issued by CPSC. In that report it is stated that the alcohol was leaking from a soldered area at the base of the copper tube. In that report it was also stated that the package had the item number, 97-5320, on the burner’s package. That is the same number that is on the 50 packages that I received.   It seems the “recalled” burners with the identification number, 97-5320, are being sold again in violation of the 2006 recall issued by CPSC. The commission states that it is illegal to resell or attempt to resell a recalled consumer product. I am prepared to ship the alcohol burners to CPSC, United States Consumer Product Safety Commission for their inspection and validation to my claim. Included in this claim are photos of: 1.My proof of purchase from Amazon .com/ by C and A Scientific via Medix Corp. 2. Photo of hole location on alcohol burner where fuel leaks in relation to rubber keep/stopper. 3. Photos of shipping container from Medix Corp. containing boxes of burners. I purchased them on March 3, 2015 (50 pcs.) see attached photo of purchase order via amazon.com filled by Medix Corp.  I suspect approximately 5-7 days after shipment they were delivered to my location.  All 50 were purchased at the same time.They were shipped in 3 shipments:3/4/15  (1 ea.)3/9/15  (32 ea.)3/17/15 (17 ea.)I discovered the leak prior to using. I followed the instructions to test for leaks before using. I turned the burner upside down and the fuel leaked from under the rubber stopper. I continued to test the burner by igniting it. After testing for approx. 1/2 hour I blew out the flame. Shortly after that,  the fuel started to slowly ooze from the holes in the coil and puddle at the base of the copper tubes where the solder is affixed to the tubes. Evidently there is residual pressure inside the body of the burner which causes fuel to rise upward via the copper tubes that extend to the bottom of burner. The tubes have a wicking material inside of them which carries fuel upward by means of capillary action. That wicking material extends all the way up to the holes where the leaks occurred.  Because the body of the burner is very warm after extinguishing the flames, there is a positive pressure inside the fuel reservoir. That pressure pushes down upon the fuel and forces it up into the copper tubes. Because the rubber stoppers do not properly cover the 2 flame holes, it seeps out.I am extremely concerned about these burners.  I need reassurance in some fashion that this will never happen again.  I will refrain from returning the burners to the Medix Corp., because. I fear they will not properly dispose of them.",Rockford,Illinois,61109,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",,Unspecified,,Yes,Yes,,No,No,No,No,The consumer has the product and they were damaged.,,,

I purchased two of these Disney Junior Minnie Cosmetics Sets yesterday, Thursday, February 18, 2016, from a Walmart Supercenter in Germantown, MD. They appear to be new items, as they were in the front of the store with all of the Easter baskets, candy, and toys, etc.All of the little dress up things are really cute, but the nail polish turned out to be dangerous. When one of my girls attempted to open it, the bottle cracked (see photos) and cut her finger very deeply leaving her bleeding profusely. We wound up in the ER and she had to get three stitches. Further, it was discovered that my other daughter's nail polish bottle was already cracked before it was even taken out of the box. Today, I went to the Walmart and showed the assistant manager the broken nail polish bottle and explained what happened. I also advised him of the other similar products that were still on the shelf and told him they should be removed. However, because my girls love the other items I did not request a refund. Nevertheless, the hair bows have a very rough clip that pulls the hair and could possibly scratch or scrape the skin. Upon noticing that this product is made in China, I am not surprised. Yet, it was mostly when I lived in India that many of the products made in China were defective and unsafe. It is a surprise to have purchased a product at Walmart, with the Disney name on it, that caused such harm to my daughter. I am very thankful that my other daughter did not touch or try to open the polish in her set as I am sure she would have needed some medical attention as well.  Thankfully, I did not have to pay for the ER visit. Otherwise, I would definitely be seeking compensation for the same as the seller and manufacturer of this product should be held responsible. Of course, the assistant manager at Walmart did nothing more than say, I'm sorry.  Most importantly, he did assure me that they would remove the products as my greatest desire is that no other child suffer as my little girl did. As a mother, it was terrifying to see my daughter bleed so profusely and struggle to get it to stop. One question I ask about this product is, Why is the nail polish bottle glass in the first place?  Most of the nail polish I see and have purchased for my girls is in a plastic container.Thank you for your attention to this matter.Regards,[REDACTED] Concerned Parent",Rockville ,Maryland,20850,Other,Injury - Emergency Department Treatment Received,Female,My Child,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,No,Yes,,I sent an email at the website and am waiting for a response.,,,

She loves drawing in the car, and she was using it while we were driving home from daycare a few days after her birthday.

I was in a residential neighborhood, and able to pull over right there. I immediately asked if she has put the pen into her mouth and she said yes. Then when I asked what happened she said something went in my mouth and I spit it out. I realized it had to be the magnetic piece that allows the device to work. I looked in her mouth, down her throat and asked numerous times if she was sure she didn't swallow something, because my first thought was that we were heading to the ER. I proceeded to scour the floors and seats looking for SOMETHING and luckily I found it!!! A tiny, cylindrical silver magnet no larger than a grain of rice. I taped it to the board so that I could report this because I hate to think of another child having done the same exact thing and swallowed a magnet without even knowing. I also had checked the trash and found the packaging, which stated small parts, not for children under age 3. it should have said DEADLY TO ALL HUMANS AND ANIMALS - DESTROY UPON CONTACT!

See link below. After putting it together, my daughter started to play with it right away.  Her father and I were playing right along with her as she explored all the the fun and attractive features. One of the main features is the pretend ice dispenser on the fridge door. It seems that she reached in the hole to get the ice and as she did so, being a small and curious child, her entire arm, lodge inside the compartment. She screamed for help immediately and began to frantically cry saying it hurt really bad. Her father and I were totally shocked when we saw how tight her arm was jammed in there. We noticed her arm, wrist, and hand start to get red and swell immediately. Luckily the door was easy to snap off even with her arm still in it and we were able to comfort her somewhat by laying her down. The slightest movement caused her arm to hurt even more. Looking at the item from the inside of the fridge door, you will notice that the way the mechanism inside the dispenser is built, it is meant to hold the ice in place by two little flaps that get released downward once the button is pressed to let the ice pass through. Once the button is released the flaps snap back into place so it made it impossible for us to simply slide her arm up as that was causing more tension and pressure. She happened to be wearing a gold bracelet on that wrist that got caught in the mechanism and made it all the worse to release her. We almost called 911 in desperation because we simply couldn't get it out.  To make matters worse, she has a cyst on her wrist that we feared could have burst from the pressure. It would have caused her a tremendous amount of pain and a trip to the ER to get it surgically removed.  It took almost 10 minutes and a bottle of oil to dislodge her arm. Needless to say, she was traumatized and asked me to remove the kitchen from her room immediately as she was very afraid. This product is dangerous!!!!!  Any other child, bigger, or smaller could get their arm caught inside and suffer he same type of injury.  I called the manufacturer and left a voicemail and wrote an email because they are closed on weekends. I plan on calling back today to place and official complaint.  I spoke to a supervisor name [REDACTED] at the Target in Stamford, CT and she seemed concerned but explained that she is not familiar with the procedure on how to get an item removed from store shelves and that she would have to get back to me. ( she did not even write my number down). I said I will personally ask for her today when I go return the kitchen to see if she followed up.  Please help me keep my child and other children safe.

I contacted the manufactured and all they said was that that happens.

Each production lot undergoes multiple physical tests before being released for shipping.  No anomalies were noted in the factory records we examined during our most recent audit in May, 2014. In addition every Walmart shipment undergoes third party testing to confirm compliance with all State and Federal regulations, Walmart testing protocols, and Ball, Bounce and Sport, Inc. product requirements.   We cannot positively determine the cause of failure without examining it. We sell many millions of these balls every year, and can positively state they are designed to be played with outdoors in a relatively rough manner such as bouncing, punching and kicking. Therefore, it is highly unusual for an incident like this to happen without the playball being exposed to some sort of very extreme condition outside of the performance parameters.  We have no record of receiving a complaint from this consumer or her father, and there is no record of anyone reporting a similar incident during this time period.  We have no way to contact this consumer directly to have a conversation regarding what happened.  We welcome this consumer to call our Customer Service number and request to speak to the Int'l Manager of Quality & Compliance. Finally, it is possible that one of our Customer Service Representatives made a comment similar to this can sometimes happen, but it is doubtful that anyone stated they were not at all concerned.  We take pride in treating people fairly and consistently. ",,

After discussion, we believe there is no defect or safety hazard on this item. The mechanism is designed to be used BY ADULTS ONLY and has specific instructions on how to open and close this item and the need for using BOTH HANDS in the process. Apparently, one hand was used causing the item to close rapidly, catching the persons finger. If the item was used as designed, both hands would have been in the correct position and making it almost impossible to catch one's finger. We clearly mark and label the item to be opened and closed by adults only.  The design is very similar to that of a normal umbrella, but purposely designed to make you use both hands, thus keeping them safely away from the closing parts. We have offered a full refund directly to the customer as well as sent a conventional play tent to the customer at No Charge, to show good faith. We believe this was an unfortunate incident, but is not indicative of a defective product. All items have been tested to the highest safety standards and we have copies of said test reports (done by certified independent laboratories). We adhere strictly to the CPSC guidelines and we take safety very seriously. We have requested the item in question be returned to us for complete inspection (at our expense) to insure there was in fact no defective parts. Upon receipt of the returned item, we will inspect thoroughly and make additional comments after that time.

We take all quality and safety issues very seriously at Kid O and immediately investigated the concerns. The Tug Boat has been on the market for more than two years, and this was the first issue we have heard of the rubber coming off.  This product has also been tested to pass all current U.S. and European safety standards, including small parts hazards.  Although the Tug Boat is not meant to be used as a teething toy, and should only be used for water play for children aged 1+, we understand younger children will put objects in their mouths and we want to avoid any potential small particles from coming off of any of our products. We found it is incredibly difficult to remove the rubber on the samples we tested in-house, however we will review the design to see if there are ways to improve this product. In the meantime, we have contacted the customer in question and offered her a replacement of another bath item that does not contain any rubber bumpers for her child. At the time of this comment, we have not heard back.   ",,

We would never want a baby to get hurt using a product that we have developed and manufactured.  Our process has gone to great lengths to prevent this.   Safety has always been the number one concern in developing, launching and selling Kleynimals.  This product has been tested multiple times to all the applicable product safety standards for children as established by the U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM).  Most recently it was retested in January 2014 and passed the ASTM F963 standard again.  This mandatory toy standard establishes nationally recognized safety requirements for toys. It is very comprehensive and incorporates test requirements for a myriad of things such as small parts, sharp edges, heavy metals, projections, in addition to safety labeling.  As with all standards for children, it is not intended to eliminate the need for the exercise of parental responsibility in selecting toys appropriate to the age of a child, or parental supervision in situations in which children of various ages may have access to the same toys.  Rather its application is intended to minimize accidents in the normal, intended use and reasonably foreseeable abuse of the toys covered by this standard.      Our website notes that babies should use Kleynimals when sitting up to avoid mishaps like the incident that was reported.  There is also a warning that babies should always be supervised when playing with Kleynimals or anything else. We are thankful that in this incident the parent was keeping careful watch over the baby and rolled the baby on its side when the baby began to gag on the Kleynimals so there was no injury to the child.     Kleynimals: An update to our previous comment, the recent testing was completed in December 2013.",,

K&M International Inc has not been given the opportunity to inspect the toy,nor has K&M had an opportunity to learn from the customer how the customer's daughter somehow sustained a small cut on her finger while playing with the toy.  The toy contains a tag which shows the toy was manufactured in 2011.  In December 2009, the snake fabric slap bracelet toy underwent rigorous third party testing by an independent testing facility to ensure that the toy was in compliance with all applicable toy safety requirements, including adherence with CPSC, ASTM,EN71 and Canadian Toy Safety regulations. The third party testing included testing for small objects,accessible sharp edges,accessible points,bite tests, age grade labeling,point and metallic wires, product markings,flammability tests and chemical tests. The snake fabric slap bracelet passed all required safety tests on Dec 8, 2009.It is unclear to K&M International Inc how the described injury occurred.  In addition to fabric surrounding the metal inside the bracelet, there is also a PVC sleeve that encapsulates the metal strip, which should prevent any contact with the metal and thus prevent injury.   Despite the snake fabric slap bracelet passing independent third party safety testing in 2009 and meeting all applicable child toy safety regulations, K&M has continued to voluntarily improve the safety and quality of the product-above and beyond CPSC and other applicable toy safety regulations.   In addition to the PVC sleeve that encapsulates the metal strip, K&M has added a layer of tape that encompasses the metal inside the bracelet, has thickened and widened the PVC sleeve material, and now the newer versions of the toy have three layers of protection; tape on the metal, PVC sleeve and a fabric cover. Certain later versions of the toy also include an additional product warning that states If Fabric Tears Please Discard.

I selected one that had received very high reviews on Amazon.com and was described by the manufacturer as appropriate for ages 36 months and up. In December of 2013, my daughter (then 4) was toddling near the castle and fell on it, hitting its wooden corner and cutting her chin open to the extent that she needed to be taken to urgent care, where the doctor had to put in 3 stitches to close the wound. I can obtain medical records for this incident upon request. I emailed the manufacturer to make them aware of the injury, but received no response (I believe I checked that no response was needed). Thinking it was just a freak accident, I continued to let my child use the castle. On December 1, 2014, she again tumbled onto the castle and received a painful cut on her lip, causing significant bleeding. Upon examination I saw it was not severe enough to require medical attention, but it opened my eyes to the fact that the previous incident was not a freak accident, but a dangerous flaw with the toy's design.

She has not used it recently so I decided to put it up.  I initially disconnected the bottom fiberglass rod and attempted to fold the tent up multiple times.  Each time I was unable to make it small enough to fit into the provided bag.  It appeared to be under immense pressure just with folding it once.  This included folding and the rods inside crossing.  I felt that I needed to attempt something different and safer to secure the tent.  The bottom rod is attached with a small metallic tubular piece with no apparent locking mechanism.  This initially feel off with my first previously mentioned attempt.  I removed this rod completely from the tent in an attempt at putting it up in a safer manner with less stored energy.  After removing this piece I was able to fold the tent with the other rods in it twice.  This made it small enough to fit into the provided storage bag.  I placed it in the bag and left it open.  At this point I began to roll up the piece that was removed.  I placed the metallic tubular piece to make a solid piece.  This piece was coiled up and I was holding it securely in my left hand.  I was preparing to place it into the bag provided by the manufacturer.  While holding it firmly the coiled piece sprung loose, the metallic tubular piece flew off, and the fiberglass pole struck me in the face with an immense amount of pressure.  I was struck across the top of my top lip, then on my left hand.  The impact almost immediately caused angioedema to my upper lip.  This edema made my top lip almost double in size, causing numbness and pain.  Later on I felt prickling on my left hand which I believe to be minute pieces of fiberglass.  This narrative was written approximately 45 minuets after the incident occurred.  It occurred at approximately 1930 eastern standard time in my den at my home.  I was sitting in a revolving office chair when this happened.  My family including my three year old daughter were sitting on the couch behind me (my back was to them) when this occurred.  I immediately checked them for injuries and luckily they were ok and unharmed.  After this occurred I zipped up the provided bag for tent with the tent in it, then I took the other fiberglass rod outside and placed it on the ground near my building for disposal.  After this trauma occurred I googled the product, immediately viewing product recall information.

The student ended up in the ER due to an asthma attack from inhaling the color powder. The people working at the ER were shocked that these fundraisers are still allowed for children, and said they had seen quite a few cases of this. Knowing that we aren't even supposed to use baby powder on our children for fear of inhalation, I was suspicious of the safety and brought the concern to administration at my child's school. They read to me a blurb from the manufacturer and stated that the cornstarch and food dye mixture was FDA approved. I said that means for eating, and they corrected me saying it was safe for inhaling. I have confirmed with a pharmacist at the FDA that their approval is for eating these ingredients, not for throwing and (inevitably) inhaling. I believe the information being supplied by the color run companies is misleading and giving people a false sense of safety concerning the way these are being used.

The tambourine is sealed in a plastic package with a couple of holes. On Sunday (12/4/16), while opening the package, as any reasonable person, I broke the package by pressing my right index finger through one of the holes. While the package was breaking open, my right index finger scraped against one of the tambourine cymbals - this resulted in a very deep (1/4 inch wide / 1/2 inch long) removal of skin from the tip of my index finger. I had applied pressure - however, due to the depth of the cut, bleeding would not stop and a family member took me to urgent care. Once I was checked in and had a doctor look at my finger, it was 1 hour from the time of the incident and the cut was still bleeding profusely. Due to the location as well as the width of the cut, stitches could not be applied - therefore, they attempted to apply surgical dermabond - it took 2 doses before the bleeding was somewhat contained. I was then instructed to keep my right hand above my heart for at least 24 hours and to not do anything strenuous (i.e. pick up my children) - in order to ensure that my finger would not start bleeding again. As a result I was home from work during the day on Monday (12/5/16) and my husband was home from work during the evening on Monday (12/6/16) to support me with the kids. I had limited use of my index finger for 2.5 to 3 weeks since it was bandaged until the dermabond naturally fell off. My index finger currently has a scar with some loss in sensation.This tambourine was purchased by my sister just before Thanksgiving from Target and was given as a gift to my 3 year old son. I was opening the package in front of him when this happened. After the incident and upon further inspection of the cymbals of the tambourine, the edge of the cymbals are EXTREMELY sharp. I cannot imagine that this product is out in the market and it is being marketed for 3 year olds.Note: I had contacted Target on Monday (12/5/16) and they generated a case on my behalf.

The bump is still present one year  and a half after impact.  If it was an inch lower she would have lost her eye.

There is a mechanism at the top of the tent that is pushed down a center support pole and locks four metal locking supports into place (which in turn connect to the four structural tent rods) in order to set up the tent (i.e. the one touch system).  In order to take the tent back down, per the instructions, the locking supports are supposed to be slowly raised while holding the center rod.  However, the locking supports are released with very little upward force.  After the release is triggered, the four locking supports thrust upward along the center pole quickly and with great force.  There is no safety stop in place in order to prevent the center mechanism from sliding up the center pole to the top of the tent, where it is then pressed firmly against the top plastic piece that connects the four tent rods.  This puts anyone (child or adult) at risk of having fingers or skin pinched and/or crushed in between the center mechanism and the top plastic piece.   The date of the incident was 10/31/2017.  The tent was set up in our family room.  My two-year-old son was able to pull the tent down on to its side, access and release the center support mechanism.  His left thumb became caught/pinched between the center support mechanism and the top plastic piece.  He was in great pain and unable to release his thumb from the tent. My wife and I were afraid to push the center support back down the center pole for fear that it could increase the pinching force on his thumb.  Ultimately I unscrewed some of the screws in the center mechanism, and it released.  The tip of my son's thumb was pinched very hard.  It appeared disfigured and was nearly crushed.  We took him to urgent care and had it evaluated.  Thankfully, he did not lose any part of his thumb.  However, had we not reacted quickly to dissemble the mechanism, I have no doubt his thumb could have been severely permanently damaged and/or at risk of needing partial amputation.  There is also a review on Amazon (which I did not read until after this incident) detailing a similar incident involving an adult whose finger was crushed by this tent in the same manner.

Some of the darts available have hard plastic tips covered by a thin foam that does little to absorb the impact of the hard plastic tip.

His friend had just received a Ravager Nerf dart gun that day as a present, and was shooting it with instructions not to aim at anyone's head. My son's friend (age 7) fired at my son from about 20 feet away at an angle (approximately 7 O'clock relative to my son at 12 O'clock). The dart hit my son in the eye, causing immediate redness in his eye, tearing, swelling in the eye, and swelling of surrounding tissue. He was taken to the ER, where they ruled out corneal abrasion (apparently common with these darts) and recommended follow-up with an ophthalmologist. The ophthalmologist confirmed that eye injuries are common with Nerf dart guns and noted an oblong and sluggish pupil that was larger than the uninjured eye. She diagnosed him with 1 to 2+cell and flayer, slight conjunctival injection, traumatic iritis and traumatic aniscoria. He was prescribed steroid drops.

We took him to our local hospital and they transferred him to [REDACTED] where he spent the next six days as they tried to get the magnets out. 1st naturally which failed. 2nd via colonoscopy which failed.

There were 2 packets of glitter included (to be mixed in)  The green glitter was larger and more manageable.  The other glitter was red and very very fine - when the packet was opened, it spilled all over my granddaughter and everywhere in my kitchen.  My granddaughter had it all over herself and was coughing from it.  She continued to cough all afternoon.  This glitter substance is so fine and unmanageable that it could pose an extreme risk to somebody with respiratory disorders, asthma or a bad cold.  They need to do something about this immediately.

The next morning, she was still acting fussy. I breastfed my baby laid down with her and within 15 minutes she began projectile vomiting.

We were transferred to the Christus Santa Rosa Children Hospital where, after seeing multiple doctors, my daughter received a major surgery to remove an enlarged Marvel Bead from her lower intestine.

While we understand the consumer’s concern about the product’s design, we are relieved to know that no serious injury occurred, as the safety of our consumers and their children is our utmost priority. Independent laboratory testing confirmed that this product and packaging conformed to applicable standards and are marked clearly with suitable warnings, instructions and the appropriate age grading. With respect to the consumer’s comments about how the plastic pieces on the product allegedly “came off almost immediately” and her child got a piece “stuck up her nose,” please note that the testing determined that the product contained or could generate small parts and was labeled with the required choking hazard warning. In addition, the consumer stated that her child was 2 years old at the time of the incident, yet the packaging clearly states an age grade of 4+.  Finally, after the consumer noticed the pieces coming off, she was unable to find and dispose of all of them before her child discovered it on her own which led to the incident.  These facts reiterate the importance of reviewing a product’s warnings and respecting the age appropriateness and maturity of children who should be allowed to interact with such products.  We have not received other complaints involving the issue brought up by this consumer.As noted above, we investigate all inquiries and incidents, and if appropriate, we incorporate any needed changes to the product or instructions for future production. Since individual circumstances are unique and safety is our top priority, we normally contact the consumer to collect further details and request them to send back the product in question to help us to better understand the issue and address any concerns. This information is always helpful to us, as Disguise is committed to continuous consumer feedback and product improvement as part of making high quality products.  However, since the consumer did not release any contact information to us, our team is unable to follow-up with her directly to confirm that the product is manufactured by Disguise and if so, to request its return.

Company in places like company hosted websites, TV Commercials, and online marketing videos, and product box, resulting in one child suffering injury. In addition, the product is not safe for children when filled more than a baseball. The company encourages children to fill product with water size of baseball to bigger size which when big becomes a safety issue due to heavy weight of water and off balance of product, not uniform, when it becomes stretchy.Three children referenced used product as encouraged in TV Commercial advertisement and youtube video on company website. Children used product as shown on box.In addition, the product renders a strong chemical smell which is alarming to me. Furthermore, the product contains misleading information like the product will not pop and that there will not be broken pieces from using the product. In fact, 4 in the set of 8 are not reusable after initial use which was date of injury, 4/23/17. NSI encourages children to Fill 'Em Big which implied children to fill as large as what was advertised by company hosted marketing and sales ads online and in TV Commercials. This created a safety hazard. One child to injury to both knees while running with the product, as it was not easy to grip. Filling the product big with water renders the product a safety concern as the stretchy nature of the product makes it hard for children to grip with one or more hands and to throw. Also the company promotes having the product filled big and left on center step of concrete stairs while person is walking down those stairs. This is falling hazard. The product is misleading when it states the product will not pop, and no clean up and reusable as some of them did pop in which many of the 8 are not reusable, and it was time consuming to locate pieces of product.Product website: http://waterwubble.com/?gclid=Cj0KEQjwxPbHBRCdxJLF3qen3dYBEiQAMRyxSyPx8yCLtxzwhY6-pGEZcDWE_431MAwA8QZMlxWpxG4aAqPB8P8HAQNote at image bottom of page stretchiest.

Because the product stretches to even larger than a basketball, it is hard for children to hold with one and two hands which causes safety concern.  The product advertises children throwing the product while running on concrete and other hard wet and dry surfaces which could lead to tripping, slipping, and falling.  In my opinion based on experience, the product is not safe when children Fill 'Em Big as company encourages children to do. The product gives an age of 6+ in which based on experience, in my opinion, the product is not safe for children under the age of 13, as the product can be filled up more than the size of a baseball and this creates safety concerns. The more water filled up in the stretchy product above the size of a baseball, the more it can be safety hazard to children, as the weight of water and stretchy material of product is hard for a child to handle.The product should not be advertised for children to play with it going down concrete steps especially but not limited to the step the child is about to step on which if child steps on stretch filled water product, it could cause tripping injury. The product should not be advertised for children to run on concrete or hard surface of surrounding pool deck as that could lead to falling.The Golden Rule for children safety is to Walk, not run, around pool, and certainly not sneak up on people and run around hard surface of pool deck. Yet the product is advertised to be used by children while running around pool which is safety concern.In my opinion based on experience, this product should not be advertised to be filled up to size of basketball then have child try and grip or bounce on concrete, as this could lead to slipping.The product advertises that it is reusable, even when thrown at tree trunk which is misleading. 4 of the 8 pieces in set are not reusable after one time use. If the product is for children under the age of 13, it should only be used on grass. It should not be able to stretch to the size of a basketball, as that makes it hard for a child to grip and handle.The website also contains broken links and no online instructions anywhere including but not limited to company site: www.wubbleball.com/instructions or www.waterwubble.com ,no refund policy information, and no information to report a product or injury complaint.

We encourage our customers to provide additional information about incidents to our customer service department by email at custserv@nsi-int.com or by calling us at 888-425-9113.     Thank you for notifying NSI International, Inc. of this incident –Report  20170424-AAE75-2147404080.  NSI International, Inc. has sold over 4,000,000 patented Wubble Balls worldwide, with Water Wubble waterballoon balls introduced in 2016. This is the first report of a consumer “safety incident” received regarding Water Wubble waterballoon balls, and only the fourth inquiry in four years regarding safety of Wubble brand balls. Given the physical play of the product and the user base, we are certain you would agree that these are excellent statistics.All our products are tested to and in compliance with all applicable safety standards and are labeled in accordance to US regulations. Copies of all these reports have been supplied under separate cover to the CPSC.  Our product, when used as instructed – and even when abused far beyond the thresholds which we advise – are safe, durable, and fun.  Water Wubbles are reusable and refillable to variable sizes. They will not pop unless they are deliberately punctured by the user, come in contact with very sharp objects, or are dramatically abused beyond foreseeable use and abuse..The injury sustained appears to be skinned knees. The incident reported by the consumer states that “NSI encourages children to “Fill ‘Em Big” and that such suggestion caused a child to sustain “injury to both knees while running with the product, as it was not easy to grip.”  In fact, nowhere on the packaging, instructions or NSI’s television advertising does it deliberately state or encourage the user to “Fill ‘Em Big” – it is actually another manufacturer (Zuru) that makes that statement for its competitive product “Bunch O Balloons”.  The included instruction sheet for NSI’s Water Wubble product clearly states “We recommend filling to a size that is comfortable in your hand” and nowhere in NSI-sponsored advertising is the product shown being filled/handled by a user to a size larger than a baseball. It is also important to note that NSII cannot control the physical dexterity of our users.The consumer goes on to state that the product is shown, in her opinion, being used in an unsafe manner i.e. – on a pool deck, on a concrete patio and that the age grading at 6+ should indicate that the product should only be played with on a grassy surface.  It is the natural and historical play pattern of the product as a WATER balloonball that it should be played with in a myriad of outdoor warm weather venues – pools, decks, patios, beaches, parks, etc. Children of all ages have played with water-filled balloons since their invention in the 1950’s. The tripping and falling safety concerns expressed by the consumer could occur with any toy or misplaced object, not just a waterballoon ball or common water balloon, therefore, parental common sense must dictate as to supervising children at play in their specific environments, be it outdoors or indoors.In a telephone call between NSI personnel and the consumer, nothing was stated by the consumer about the “smell” of the product which she mentions in her complaint.  Any scent from the material is caused by the material itself, which is tested as part of NSI’s safety testing protocol, has been reviewed and approved for use in toys by an independent board-certified registered toxicologist, and is in full compliance with all US toy and children’s products regulations The report supplied to NSI International states that the consumer has not contacted us but plans to do so. The consumer has reached out to NSI via telephone and has spoken with our consumer service department, our Wubble “brand ambassador” and finally the President of NSI International. This complaint appears to be based not the product itself, but on the consumer’s personal parental belief that childhood play is inherently dangerous. To reiterate, it cannot be stressed enough that parental common sense must dictate as to supervising children at play in their specific environments, be it outdoors or indoors.Again, NSI International, Inc. takes the safety of our products and our consumers seriously (We’re all concerned parents too!) and it is our goal to provide 100% safe products and consumer satisfaction.

[REDACTED] wanted to show off his new sword.  The sword is known as the Anime Reinos De Rasos Charlotte Cuulhourne Sword.  It measures 41 inches in length, and features a 440 stainless steel blade with a length of 27 inches.  The sword was given to [REDACTED]'s aunt, [REDACTED], at an employee awards banquet in October, 2012.  [REDACTED]'s boss, [REDACTED], purchased approximately 28 units of the sword from a company called Top Swords, LLC, headquartered in Dallas, Georgia.  Having no use for a samurai sword, [REDACTED] gave it to her brother, [REDACTED].  The sword went into storage for approximately four years before resurfacing in the [REDACTED]s' home last fall.On the day in question, [REDACTED] and his friends took the sword outside and were taking turns attempting to chop plastic water bottles tossed into the air.  [REDACTED] tossed a water bottle for his friend, fifteen year-old, [REDACTED], who took a mighty swing.  As [REDACTED] swung the sword, the blade disengaged from the handle, flew as much as twenty feet through the air, and impaled [REDACTED] through the forehead.  The incident was captured on cell phone video.[REDACTED] was rushed by EMS to University of Louisville Hospital.  He was diagnosed with a penetrating traumatic brain injury with brain compression, malignant edema, intraventricular hemorrhage, subdural hemorrhage and bilateral anterior cerebral territory infarct.  [REDACTED] was intubated and ventilated, underwent a bicoronal craniectomy, endured placement of an extraventricular drain, received a tracheostomy, had a PEG tube placed, and spent approximately six weeks in a coma before being discharged to a rehabilitation hospital.  He underwent a second surgery yesterday to replace the top of his cranium which had been removed to allow for brain swelling.  [REDACTED]'s medical expenses are now in excess of $1,000,000.00.Investigation revealed that the sword in question was not a full tang sword, i.e., the blade did not extend through the handle, nor was it a rat tail tang sword in which the blade extends well into the handle but tapers substantially.  The blade of this particular sword extended only 7 centimeters into the handle of the sword.  Furthermore, the blade was not secured by bolts or rivets running through the handle and the blade, but by what appears to be rubber cement.  The sword was clearly not intended as a battle sword but there is no way for anyone to know that.  There are no warnings on the sword itself.  There are no warnings on the packaging.  There are no warnings on Top Swords, LLC's website.  The sword by design, manufacture, marketing and labeling is inherently dangerous and defective.Additionally, my investigation has revealed that cheap samurai sword blade disengagements are not unheard of.

My 9 year old son was playing with it, building a shooter device to shoot the included foam marshmallow pieces.  In order for the device to work you have to blow through the connected tubes and the foam pieces shoot out into the air.  He decided to load a bunch and start shooting multiple pieces.  Then he decided he wanted them to shoot out really far across the room so he took a really big breath to inhale while his mouth was on the tube and he sucked in some of the foam pieces and started to choke.  He really startled him and he began turning purple and was not able to cough at all.  We flipped him upside down and patted him very firmly across his back until he was able to cough and take a breath.  Unfortunately he was not able to cough the pieces up so they were swallowed.  We have no idea how many he actually swallowed but it was extremely scary and had he not started coughing we almost called 911 and had a much scarier situation on our hands.

With respect to the consumer’s concern regarding a potential strangulation hazard, testing confirmed that no such hazard exists and therefore the product does not require a choking hazard warning.  In addition, the toy tool belt was intentionally designed to have a breakaway feature (secured by Velcro) such that it easily releases from the child when pulled.

Since individual circumstances are unique and safety is our top priority, we normally contact the consumer to collect further details and request them to send back the product in question to help us to better understand the issue and address any concerns.  This information is always helpful to us as we committed to continuous consumer feedback and product improvement as part of making high quality products.

Two of them are in the pharynx. They appear to the right of midline on the frontal radiograph suggesting that they may be lodged in the right piriform sinus. Nine magnets are present projecting over the distal stomach. In each case both clusters of magnets have a linear arrangement and touch each other. However it is not possible to determine if they are intervening anatomic structures, such as an aryepiglottic foldor the bowel wall. Therefore surgical ENT and surgical consultation is warranted. The lungs are clear. The heart size is normal. The bowel gas pattern is normal. No airway abnormality. No bony abnormality. IMPRESSION:   Two magnets in the pharynx, likely in the piriform sinus, and nine linearly arranged contacting magnets projecting over the distal stomach. It is not possible to determine if they are intervening anatomic structures, such as an aryepiglottic fold or the bowel wall, and if so these structures both the large airways which could result in immediate death and the gastrointestinal tract are at risk for pressure necrosis and further more serious complications. The patient was transported to [REDACTED] and then take from the ER to the OR and the magnets removed after anesthesia.  There were 11 magnets in all; 2 of which were at the arytenoids, and just about to go into the trachea - which would have killed this little boy and the 9 others were in the 3rd part of the duodenum and with some care, they were removed as well.The patient remained under observation with IVF and monitoring and once tolerating PO will go home.",Buford,Georgia,30519,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Hospital Admission,Male,Unspecified,5.0,No,No,,,No,No,,,,,

A few of us used it today. It made two of us sick (headaches, rapid heartbeat, general feelings of sickness). These people were both within the recommended age range and do not have pacemakers etc. Note that for some individuals, this toy might be extremely dangerous, even lethal. It emits an electric shock on a person's hand which feels pretty similar to accidentally putting one's finger in an electrical socket. It contains some warnings in fine print that: it is not for use for people with epilepsy, a heart condition, or similar related illnesses. It also says, in some of the fine print sections, but not all, that it should not be used by someone pregnant and to keep out of the risk of children. We had no idea what we were buying. We thought it had a shock similar to the old board game Operation, certainly not something painful or potentially dangerous. Clearly people do not always read fine print, especially not on a toy, which people expect to be safe. Not just that, the fine print isn't even the same in each spot so someone who actually does read the fine print might miss a crucial warning that applies to them. And if the wrong person uses this item, I believe they could die or be seriously injured.Please investigate and remove this game from the US market asap.

The father reportedly purchased Buckyball brand magnets 'well over' 5 years ago, before they had children. We (physicians) clarified this point with the family; the father was certain it was Buckyball brand product, as opposed to another high-powered magnet brand, and bought them shortly after the product became available in the U.S. The family still has the magnets but does not have any packaging or storage containers. They do not believe they still have receipts or proof of purchase but will double check. The parents were aware of the dangers of these products and stored them on top of the refrigerator. From time to time, Mom stated that she will find some magnets 'in the couch or around the house' and that 'they are very easy to misplace.' She presumes this is how her 5-year old found the magnets, as the bulk of the product remained out of reach on top of the refrigerator. In addition, Mom notes that her child (5 years old) has played with the product before (while supervised) without incident, though the child was not playing with the product when the ingestion occurred.On June 5th, 2020, the patient came to his mother and told her that he swallowed 3 high-powered magnets and that his throat hurt. Mom called the Poison Center which, in turn, referred the patient to our ED.In our ED, his vitals were stable and normal. He had no difficulty swallowing, no difficulty handling his secretions, no respiratory distress, no drooling, no vomiting and no chest or abdominal pain. He was otherwise at baseline in terms of his health with no recent illness, fevers, vomiting, diarrhea, rashes. His physical exam was completely normal. Abdominal XR imaging was done which showed 3 rounded, radiopaque densities abutting one another, corresponding to the ingested magnetic bucky balls favored to be in the stomach but positioned in close proximity to the transverse colon. Decision was made for patient to have urgent endoscopic retrieval. He was also evaluated by pediatric surgery who agreed with plan. On endoscopy, 3 round 5mm neodymium magnets were found in the distal duodenum/early jejunum and were retrieved with a basket. There was some technical challenge and difficulty with the procedure given how much the magnets had migrated but ultimately the magnets were able to retrieved successfully. The patient recovered well after the procedure and was admitted for further care and observation. The following morning he was well appearing and stable. He was able to eat breakfast without issues. He was discharged home that day, June 6th, 2020.",Bronx,New York,10463,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Hospital Admission,Male,Unspecified,5.0,No,No,,,No,No,No,,,,

Eventually, between five adults we were able to find a way to move the plastic pieces just so, allowing her to wiggle her finger out. It was an ordeal that took many minutes, all during which my niece and her mother were worried her finger was going to get badly cut.

She was swimming at the bottom of the pool and shot up for a breath of air, not paying attention to what was above her (as kids do), and literally got stuck by the top of her head in the velcro to the Bullseye Dart Toss game by Play Day that is sold at Walmart for $14.97. The toy was blown over during normal pool play, and the large velcro part was face down. Furthermore, the part that was facing up is a bowl shape and had filled with water, making it very heavy. She is an extremely strong swimmer and was able to get to the steps with minimal air and scream out for me. There was even a lifeguard at the party who thought she was just playing around with the float until she heard her cries. Her entire head of hair was tangled up in the velcro terribly. She does have curly hair, so I'm not sure if that was a factor, but it took 5 adults to pull her and the float out of the water, drain it, and then an excruciating 20 minutes of pulling her hair out of the velcro while she scream cried. If that had happened to a less strong swimmer, it could have very easily been a terrible tragedy. If my daughter had panicked or didn't have any breath left, it could have been a terrible tragedy.

It was determined, he ingested 15 of these 5MM magnetic balls. Formerly known as [REDACTED], but renamed as many different brands. These were a gift for Christmas to my older child who is 6 years old. It came in 1000 pieces, so we were very clear with him that they should not be on the ground or in their 2 year old brothers hands. A thousand pieces... these products are used to shape, stick and reform to whatever your mind can think of. The advertisements on all of these magnetic ball ads say that they are for creative minds, therapeutic & stress relievers. My 6 year old used them to make necklaces, stick them to metal objects and create shapes. Sadly having 1000 pieces, some had strayed off around the house. The damages and injuries these magnetic balls have caused to my child and family are devastating. My son started with throwing up for 2 days and could not stomach water. Once confirmed that the magnetic balls were in his body, it was declared he needed an emergency operation. They opened up my sons stomach to reach his intestines where they found severe damages. Perforations and holes were caused by the magnets. They removed 6cm worth of damaged intestine. They had to stitch the other damaged parts and holes that were caused. We are not the first victims and there are many different victims in various ages to have been injured. The balls being powerfully strong, cause rubbing and perforation as they made its way down. Potentially it can cause a lot more damage if it doesn’t get the proper attention right away. The Amazon ad DID NOT HAVE A DISCLAIMER ABOUT INGESTING. CHOKING ONLY.

We put a twin mattress in it and laid it directly on the floor (as the website states as an option).  On the second night of him using it, he wedged himself between the mattress and the side of the tent, face down. Because he is sensory seeking, it appears that he liked the pressure it provided on his body, but because he was face down, he had inadequate air supply. We're glad we caught this soon after it happened because I imagine he would have become hypoxic if he had been in this position for a prolonged period of time. Although the tent seems like a great option for older autistic children, I would not recommend it for toddlers who are able to fit in between the mattress and tent when the tent is used with a mattress on the floor.

First, the required childrens product labeling on the product is missing (there is only a flammability tag). Second, the manufacturer (Simulated Wood Grains LLC d/b/a Fort) has declined to share any specific safety testing information despite multiple requests. Third, the magnets in this product were initially supposed to be (1) larger than a quarter, (2) encased in a plastic casing, and (3) sewn into the product with no zipper access. Instead, the product I received has rare earth magnets that are smaller than a quarter (so would NOT pass small parts test tube requirements), that are not encased at all, and are only glued into pouches; on my product, I had at least 2 pouches when opening the product with OPEN FLAPS and exposed magnets. And zippers were added to the product and those zippers are NOT safety zippers and are operational by my 6 year old. The manufacturer (d/b/a Fort) has merely told consumers to re-stick any loose pouches by giving them a high five and that it  should hold and simultaneously suggested to other users of the product to not pick at the magnet pockets as that may lead to loose magnets... except that is exactly what a child would do. In other correspondence, the manufacturer has actually stated that the magnet pouches are glued to enable better access to the magnets in the event of damage/replacement, meaning that this was an intentional design to access magnets on a childrens' product.

We thought it was food poisoning from a veggie burger she had eaten as the rest of us had hamburgers and were fine.  Since we were in covid lockdown, we knew she couldn't have a stomach bug.  She got a good night's sleep and was fine for almost 4 days.  On May 15, 2020, again at dinner time, she said her stomach was killing her.  She was up all night in pain, and vomited a lot more this time.  As if it was 4 days worth of food.  The vomiting continued into the next morning.  I decided to call the pediatrician as I figured it had to be her appendix.  We did a telehealth call and they sent us to Boston Children's Hospital for an exam.  The ER sent us to x-ray and right away the xray showed 3 little dots.  We asked my daughter and she admitted to swallowing the Zen Magnets.  The magnets perforated her bowels and created a blockage.  In the very early morning of May 17, 2020, Boston Children's Hospital was able to remove the magnets and repair her bowels.

Originally, the covers were supposed to be non-removable, but that was changed and to make them safe, [REDACTED] breakaway zippers were going to be used. NONE of these safety features were used. The magnets are smaller than a quarter, they are not in pouches, and they are not sewn in. The magnets are placed in the cover via a slit made in the back and then a small circle cover is glued on over. The glue is not strong and the circle covers come off leaving exposed magnets. The zippers are not [REDACTED] and are not breakaway. This allows for kids to open covers and get to said exposed magnets. The seams are not very strong and ripping open with normal play and some are arriving already busted. This allows easier access to the magnets. Some FORTs have arrived with broken magnets which are sharp and a huge hazard if swallowed. A child had their finger pinched between two magnets when they found them on the outside of the cover while the parent checked and assembled the rest of the covers. Another concern is [REDACTED not having the proper CPSC tracking tags on the FORTs. He markets them as a kids toy, but the FORTs only come with a flammable furniture tag and nothing else regarding toys.Overall, the magnets are not safe and are a huge choking hazard and can cause severe GI damage if multiples are swallowed.

This evening, my husband and I discovered that the magnetic ball point was missing from our child's magnetic stylus pen. As we had never disassembled the pen before, we were uncertain about the method used to secure its components. Upon opening the casing, it became evident that there was no permanent solution in place to firmly hold the magnet. Just before contemplating a visit to the emergency room to ensure that the missing piece had not been swallowed, I fortunately located the magnet. To my surprise, the magnet lacked any discernible fatter end or edge that could effectively secure it within the pen casing. Instead, it was simply a miniature, [REDACTED]-sized magnet loosely positioned within the stylus pen. This unrestricted movement poses a grave risk and is highly dangerous. In light of this alarming discovery, I strongly recommend that Brooklyn Lollipops initiate an immediate product recall and undertake a comprehensive redesign of the magnetic pen stylus. The current design flaw not only endangers the welfare of children but also raises the potential for severe harm or even fatal consequences. It is fortunate that no child has suffered a tragic incident related to this product thus far. I implore the CPSC to thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate action to ensure the safety of consumers, particularly children, who may come into contact with the Brooklyn Lollipops' Rainbow Magnetic Sketcher. It is crucial that strict measures are implemented to rectify the hazardous design of the magnetic stylus, thereby mitigating the potential for serious accidents or injuries. Thank you for your attention to this urgent matter, and I trust that the CPSC will prioritize the well-being of consumers by promptly addressing this safety concern.",Portage,Wisconsin,53901,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Male,My Child,1.0,Yes,No,,,,Yes,,,,,

She now lives with a brain injury called toxic brain encephalopathy. Below is a call to action… What Physicians Need to Know about Water BeadsPlay is the occupation of childhood, toys are the tools and materials of the trade. [REDACTED]. To better prevent, identify, and protect children from potential risks posed by toy products, physicians and researchers must view children as a unique class of workman. Despite the fact that children are not merely miniature adults, and have certain distinct vulnerabilities, the value of occupational medicine perspectives, literature, and expertise can not be overemphasized when assessing potential toy related hazards, and analyzing cases of real world harm associated with play, the pediatric occupation. What physicians need to know about water beads is an illustrative example of this significance. Originally used for industrial purposes, recently water beads have been heavily marketed as a “non-toxic” sensory toy for children and as ammunition for a new type of toy gun.  Water beads are sold under a variety of brand names. The beads are often imported and sold as both an agricultural soil conditioner and as a toy for children without the chemical ingredients and composition listed on the product’s label. Water beads/ Super absorbent polymer balls are designed to absorb water, expand in size and volume, and are most often made of polyacrylamide-polyacrylate ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide is considered non-toxic; however, it is made from the polymerization of neurotoxic acrylamide. [REDACTED][REDACTED]. According to the [REDACTED], polymerized acrylamide gels should be treated with the same caution as acrylamide monomers themselves to avoid repeated accidental exposure to neurotoxic acrylamide monomers ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide solid gels, such as water beads, can contain residual and extremely toxic acrylamide monomers in concentrations of 10-30% ([REDACTED]). Although water bead toys meet current CPSIA standards for heavy metal and phthalate levels, each batch and bag of beads is not required to be pre-tested for monomer concentration levels before being placed in commerce. Acrylamide monomers are easily absorbed into an organism's circulatory system from dermal exposure, inhalation, and ingestion ([REDACTED]). Polyacrylamide for agricultural purposes is legally permitted to contain a residual level of acrylamide thousands of times greater in concentration than polyacrylamide used in cosmetic formulations and water treatment for drinking water; 500 ppm for agricultural purposes, 0.1 to 0.5ppm for cosmetics, and the residual acrylamide limit for water suppliers by the EPA is less than 0.5 ppb ([REDACTED]). Manufacturers are not required to disclose the initial concentration of acrylamide monomer used to create their polyacrylamide or the amount of residual acrylamide monomer remaining after polymerization in any polyacrylamide-copolymer contained in toy products. When ingestion of water beads is suspected, a high degree of suspicion is necessary. The beads do not behave as traditional foreign bodies due to their size and chemical composition. The chemical composition of the beads is generally unknown to physicians at the point of care and consumers at the point of purchase. Consumption and aspiration of water beads pose a public health risk, and the public should be informed of the dangers ([REDACTED]). Although acrylamide loses some toxicity after polymerization, it can still cause chemical corrosion of the nasal mucosa and can enter the digestive and respiratory tracts, where it is absorbed, entering the systemic circulation and causing toxic reactions ([REDACTED]). [REDACTED]. Additionally, the reduction in gastric protective factors caused by acrylamide exposure also contributes to the dose-dependent degeneration of gastric mucosal integrity, putting the patient's mucosa at risk for erosions and lesions ([REDACTED]).Water beads are banned in Italy and Malaysia because they are a safety hazard. Water beads should not be marketed to children and their families as toys, sensory toys, or therapeutic aids. Because non-toxic is not a regulated term, “non-toxic” claims on a product's label or online listing should not be solely relied upon to eliminate poisoning or chemical exposure from the initial diagnostic assessment or the formation of differential diagnoses. Information and researchIngestion of water beads requires prompt medical attention and evaluation. Diagnosis is made more complicated due to imaging difficulties. ([REDACTED]) Prompt endoscopic removal should be attempted for all patients with no signs of obstruction whenever the gel beads might be in the upper GI tract ([REDACTED]).Case management should not conform to standard protocols of foreign body removal, and early removal whenever possible should be attempted to prevent complications such as obstruction, lung injuries, nasal cavity injuries, hearing loss, seizures, brain injury such as cytotoxic edema, encephalopathy, and exposure to toxic chemicals specifically, extremely neurotoxic acrylamide ([REDACTED]). A high degree of suspicion is necessary for prompt diagnosis due to imaging difficulties, beads may mimic duplicated cysts versus presenting as a traditional foreign body ([REDACTED]).Duplicate cysts are congenital GI tract alignment abnormalities. Duplicate cyst structure can be divided into cystic or tubular on the basis of their structure. Research indicates identification of duplicated cysts is best assessed using ultrasound ([REDACTED]).Due to the ability of water bead material to mimic duplicated cysts, imaging utilized to identify duplicate cyst lesion pathology, ultrasound, should be utilized during assessment for potential water bead ingestions. Medical professionals should be aware ultrasound may underestimate the number of water beads when compared to endoscopic evaluation ([REDACTED]).Water beads can collect, forming a bezoar, asymptomatically in the GI tract without belly distention or traditional GI symptoms of distress. ([REDACTED]). Surgical management with complete removal of hydrogel granules from the gastrointestinal tract is required, when the child presents to hospital with intestinal obstruction symptoms and surgeons must be aware the beads have the ability to collect lower in the GI tract and form a new mass if all beads are not removed. Surgeons should also be aware ultrasound can miss beads lower in the digestive tract ([REDACTED]).Pediatric patients who are young or non-verbal cannot be relied upon to effectively and consistently communicate pain. Furthermore, [REDACTED]Symptoms of pain or distress may be less obvious to those outside the immediate household and include increased night wakings, increased fussiness and irritability.Cases presenting with a dermatitis rash on the mouth and/or hands should be handled very carefully. The presence of a dermatitis rash should alert clinicians to the possibility the patient has suffered a higher level acrylamide dose exposure. Patients, especially ones with the rash should be monitored for follow up care and closely monitored for any signs of regression or neurological involvement. Referral to the developmental pediatrician, neurology, and ECI may be needed. A patient’s clinical history is often the cornerstone of diagnosis in neurotoxicology. Tests to identify exposure to acrylamide are not readily and widely available to clinicians: laboratory studies are unhelpful, evidence of peripheral neuropathy on nerve conduction studies supports the diagnosis of acrylamide neurotoxicity, normal studies do not exclude the diagnosis. [REDACTED]Toxicity symptoms in pediatric patients particularly, when the water bead ingestion timeframe is unknown, include: Dermatitis rash RhinorrhoeaSeizures GI symptoms such as constipation and/or diarrhea; Projectile vomiting and other traditional obvious obstruction symptoms appear after the rash and can be delayed for long periods after initial ingestion due to beads not consistently traveling through the digestive tractPediatric patients can be clingy to caregivers Increased need to nurseWeight loss with normal appetiteSigns and symptoms of motor and sensory peripheral neuropathyCytotoxic edema / cellular edema, seeming to mimic an acute ischemic stroke (EEG may be abnormal when beads are in patient according to one case study [not enough evidence to definitively say if all cases will present this way], CT scan and MRI are normal; according to radiopaedia, MRI with diffuse weighted imaging is able to identify cytotoxic edema) ([REDACTED])Toxic Brain Encephalopathy “Non-toxic” has a specific connotation; for most people it means safe, pure, and not hazardous. [REDACTED] defines the term “non-toxic” straightforwardly as, not toxic. Many consumers are under the impression that when a product is labeled non-toxic it means the product is safe, that it has been thoroughly tested, and is free of toxic chemicals. The act empowering America’s Consumer product regulatory agency is called the Federal Hazardous Substances Act. As of 2011, the term “non-toxic” does not appear in the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (FHSA), rendering the term unregulated due to a lack of a definitive legal definition. The assumption that products are safe, when they bear the label of “non-toxic”, is based on a clever marketing illusion rather than fact. [REDACTED]. Often physicians do not know the chemical composition of toys at the point of care and with approximately 88% of toy products manufactured in China and complex supply chains there is no guarantee of reliable chemical composition information. Water bead injuries, insertions and  swallowings should be reported to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Poison Control Centers.

We immediately called our pediatrician and brought her in. We left with oral [REDACTED] (anti-vomiting med) and the diagnosis that she was still recovering from the flu she was positive for 8 days priorJanuary 3rd, the vomiting continued. She wasn't keeping any food or milk down, and had 1 wet diaper in 12+ hours. We decided to take her to the emergency room.  In the ER they performed an abdominal X-ray and ultrasound, they also swabbed her nose (because that's what we do now for everyone who walks through the door with an illness) she ended up being positive for COVID, flu and rhinovirus. The X-ray was negative, but the ultrasound was very concerning, and showed some questionable cysts on her ovaries and lower abdominal quadrant, because of that we were transferred by ambulance to a children's hospital who could provide further testing. When arriving at the children's hospital they re-did all of their own testing. The first ultrasound showed a cystic structure in her right lower quadrant.. that warranted further testing.. on top of that, she was continuing to vomit profusely, unable to keep anything down. January 4th they did an oral contrast abdominal X-ray. This X-ray showed a questionable small bowel obstruction, as the contrast stopped and did not make its way into the large bowel. After this she received another abdominal ultrasound which confirmed two cystic lesions measuring 3cm and 2cm. After that, the decision was made to emergently take [REDACTED] to the OR for an exploratory laparotomy and check for ovarian contortion. The results after the OR... all clear... no bowel obstruction seen, no cysts seen AT ALL. Just an ileus... a non mechanical obstruction. I asked if they were going to place a nasal gastric tube, and they said not at this time..At first this was a relief. The doctors decided this was all related to gastroenteritis and her body just needed time to clear the viruses.. So we continued trying to feed her and get her to drink.. she continued to profusely vomit. Except her vomit was turning vile. It smelled foul, and had a stool-like appearance. We reported this to the doctors and they brushed it off. This continued for 2 days. January 6th she was getting sicker. She slept 95% of her day, only awake when the medical providers were in the room. She was vomiting so profusely she began to drop her oxygen levels. She was requiring a nasal cannula and they started her on antibiotics for possible aspiration and did a chest X-ray. We spoke to the doctors about our concerns. Things weren't adding up. We explained how her vomit smelled so horrid, it didn't look like normal stomach bile and it certainly didn't smell like it. We were told it's unlikely she's vomiting stool even though we saved all the towels and blankets with the vomit covering them. They ordered a abdominal X-ray which showed distended bowels with no obstructions visible. They said that since she got the surgical exploratory laparotomy and there was no obstruction seen at all, they were SURE her bowels just need some rest. Finally, on January 7th they placed the nasal gastric tube for decompression and bowel rest. Since she was continuing to get worse, she got another abdominal X-ray which showed dilated bowel and air.. they ordered an abdominal ultrasound that once again showed two lower abdominal cysts.. no further intervention was ordered..The next next day, January 8th, she seemed improved. Her personality was coming back, much more energy so we were able to clamp her nasal gastric tube and give her 1 ounce of breastmilk every three hours. We did two feedings like that and then tried to increase it to 2 ounces, but she returned to profuse vomiting. It continued to be foul smelling, thick stool-like appearance, it wasn't even breastmilk coming back up.We told the doctors something else is going on.. we started introducing this crazy idea we had....... the possibility that she ingested water beads, also known as [REDACTED]. We had water beads in the house for our older kids to play with. They were only ever played with during her naps and while they were under 100% supervision. About a month ago some social media posts were coming out about the dangers of these beads causing intestinal blockages, and because of that we threw them out.. or so we thought. When we brought up this idea, it was shot down, if a bead was in there obstructing we would see something on X-ray, air pockets, the blockage we'd see something and we were immediately shot down that this wasn't a possibility. The imaging wasn't showing any blockage. she continued to throw up. She continued to be unable to tolerate any food or drink. They were starting to consider putting an invasive IV in her, called a central line to start giving her nutrition that way. Once again, they ordered another abdominal X-ray... showing no obstruction. she had no not eaten/drank anything in almost a week..This continued on. They continued getting X-rays that showed nothing. They continued getting ultrasounds that showed cysts. Monday night, January 9th, we did our own research. We found medical journals, articles, social media posts. Anything we could find where we found all these other cases, all with similar symptoms as hers. None of the beads could ever be seen on X-ray, and they were all showing up as CYSTS on the ultrasounds. January 10th, Tuesday morning, we weren't taking no as an answer. We told every doctor that walked in the door about our water bead theory and we demanded that we do something else. Anything. Because things weren't adding up. She was continuing to vomit, and continue to have mysterious cysts on every single ultrasound that the doctors were insist weren't there since they weren't seen on her exploratory laparotomy. Finally, that afternoon we did a barium (contrast) enema with abdominal X-ray. One of the water beads had finally made its way far enough down into the colon that we could FINALLY see the blockage. The doctors finally believed us. And then by some miracle because that bead was so far down and with the help of the enema, she was able to pass it on her own! The proof was in the diaper. There was no more guessing. This is what we were dealing with. The problem was there was still one more. Much higher up.. The pediatric surgical team wanted to see if the bead would pass on its own. They felt at this point she had stabilized and if we could avoid surgery that would be the best option.  Her abdominal distention continued, and those two days of waiting, she was in a lot of pain and discomfort. It was awful. Two days passed and she did not pass the bead. On January 12th she went in for abdominal surgery.  The water bead was surgical removed from her small bowel, measuring just slightly smaller than a golf ball, and this time she was thoroughly checked for any remaining beads. Thankfully there were not. 5 ultrasounds, 6 abdominal X-rays, and 2 surgeries later they are finally all out. These water beads/[REDACTED] are so dangerous. They are invisible on an X-ray, and they show up as cysts on ultrasounds,Making it impossible for doctors to determine they are there. They are microscopic out of liquid and so easy for children to even accidentally swallow, and then they continue to expand greater than 1 inch once in liquid. This product being advertised as a sensory toy for kids is harmful. We didn't have these beads for her, she wasn't even allowed to play with them, but she still somehow found some, and ingested them. We had also begun the process of deep cleaning our home & have since found 12 beads.. that were invisible to the eye but after soaking toys in a bathtub overnight they were then discovered.",Biglerville ,Pennsylvania,17307,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Hospital Admission,Female,My Child,1.0,No,No,,,,No,,,,20230112-A8137-2147351450,

I received a Fort in October 2021 but received a product that had a visible zipper, magnets that were not sewn in but secured with a removable patch, and weak magnets that were incorrectly placed when manufactured. In order for the toy (he defines it as furniture) to even function as created he suggested all those who received the weak, defective axial magnets (instead of diametrical ones that most of the Forts manufactured had)  to remove half of the adhesive magnet patches and flip the magnets so the number of N and S polarities were equal. That is not only 2 painful hours of my life I will never get back, but this toy is now a huge safety hazard because the magnets (that are about the size of a nickel) are easily reachable by my 2 young kids.

How were the product(s) being used?- At the time of the injury the product was not in use, it had a failure that resulted from being used as a toy that went unnoticed. Were there any injuries that happened or may have happened while using the product?- Yes. An injury that resulted in an emergency room visit and stitches. How did any injuries occur?- The kitchen set is designed in a way that the plastic handles are affixed to the panels with what very closely resembled sheet metal screws. The screws hold the handles by being threaded from the back of the panel through the panel into a molded part of the handle that is very thin and not tapped to receive a screw, it is just small enough that it is a tight fit against the sharp sheet metal screw. The handle on the lower part of the fridge area on the kitchen set was somehow ripped off by the child during playtime which exposed one of the  the sheet metal screws pointing through. The other screw fell out of the hole but the one that caused the injury got stuck in the particle board when the handle failed. The child later in the day slipped on her blanket on the ground in front of her kitchen set when getting off her bed, she fell into the front of the kitchen set where she was scratched and stabbed by the exposed screw.

He plays with them appropriately at a table or elevated surface.Today my 1yr old brings me an orange piece of broken plastic that she found on the carpet that I recognized as a piece from one of the Qubix. I immediately went to inspect all the pieces in the container and found a loose magnet along with the majority of the 58 pieces with cracks, some of them significant. If she had swallowed loose magnets her life would have been in danger. My 1yr old isn't allowed to play with these and my 4yr old plays with them appropriately. There is no biting or stepping on them or throwing and they get cleaned up and put away each time. (We even have carpet and don't even wear shoes in the house.) I don't see how the Qubix can have such widespread and significant damage after only having one of those sets for less than 6 months and the other one just about 1.5yrs.I'm attaching photos of the cracks. In one photo the 1. pile had significant damage, 2. pile had medium cracks or separation beginning to form at the seams and 3. pile with minimal or no cracking. It's only a matter of time before all the Quibix pieces begin to break further. It's also clear that these two sets purchased from different locations, at different times are defective.I avoided buying knock of brands of other magnet products because of the risk of breaking with magnets falling out and putting my children at risk. I thought these products were better quality and therefore more safe. I am requesting full refunds for both sets as I will no longer allow my 4yr old to play with these sets that were supposed to last years as your website states.

May 2022 my  3 year old granddaughter came into contact with water beads from an unknown source. Her parents and I had no idea such toys existed. She placed the beads into her ear. No one was aware until she began having excruciating pain in her right ear. The ear became severely infected and would not respond to anti-biotics. After multiple trips to the pediatrician regarding the ear infection, she suddenly began having seizures. She was admitted in [REDACTED] Childrens Hospital. She had CT and MRI. The MRI found a shadow in her ear canal that was believed to be a cyst. During exploratory surgery the ENT extracted a water bead. It had expanded inside her ear, completely destroyed her ear drum, and entered into her inner ear. There it had festered for weeks resulting in the untreatable ear infection and triggering the onset of seizures. She spent 27 days in the hospital. 18 of those days were in the ICU on [REDACTED] and Ketamine drip. She had a complete plasma exchange to essentially replace her immune system. It has been nearly 13 months and she continues to have as many as 10 seizures per day. There is no  family history of seizures, no genetic predisposition, no brain structural anomalies. There is no other explanation for her seizures than having been caused by the damage to her body by the water beads.",Malvern,Arkansas,72104,Home/Apartment/Condominium,Injury - Hospital Admission,Female,Other Relative,3.0,,,,,,,,,,,

In November the company initially learned that a person was claiming in an Incident Report that the Product started to smoke, and presented a possible fire hazard. The company discussed that incident with that person, and continued investigating the Product. In what appears to be an isolated issue, it is believed that overheating was likely caused in one manufacturing “lot” by a malfunction in the LED light strip along the side edge of the Product. Due to the anonymous nature of the present Incident Report, the company has been unable to investigate this particular incident.Without any admission of liability or wrongdoing, the company has voluntarily discontinued future sales of the Product having the LED light strip.

This consumer/user indicated the perimeter metal ring in this product was possibly defective as this contained ring tip protruded through its protective fabric and contacted his son, requiring Band-Aid or similar medical dressing. Spin Master did not receive back this unit.This product element is a ‘foldable’ circular fabric covered play-space with a metal perimeter band inside enabling ‘twist-fold’ similar to a bandsaw blade fold-up storage. This feature enables the product to be shipped and stored in a much smaller footprint than the original play-space.  Accompanying files include images of the product.Spin Master has produced approximately 250,000 of this Bakugan Toy #64439 since June 2021, this is a single call or notification for a potential defect. This, as all Spin Master toy products, have gone through rigorous global safety and performance testing protocols exceeding ASTM mechanical requirements without exception. The twist-fold feature is environmentally tested – humidity, salt spray, temperature cycling - as well as dynamically tested through 500 minimum cycles protocol for release to the USA market. The case involved here is an isolated one possibly caused by unique series of circumstances (a) factory moisture (b) inconsistent closure crimp (c) long term retailer storage (c) ‘perfect’ user loading, or series of loading, on compromised crimp joint creating dynamic failure (d) user in the least opportune position.  Mentioned above, this is a single, isolated report of this kind for this product. Resulting from this report, Spin Master has (1) sampled inventory and (2) thoroughly reviewed/redirected the manufacturing environment of this product with high emphasis on handling and storage of raw materials as well as finished goods through this value chain. We have additionally increased the frequency of finished goods destructive testing in assurance neither rusted perimeter band nor compromised crimp-joint can be released to the market. Spin Master Consumer Care team has subsequently contacted [REDACTED], assured his son is uninjured, and directly resolved the case with a full product replacement.

The bubble solution leaked out of the gun covering the outside of her hands for approx 10 minutes or less.  The outside of her hands and wrists / forearms turned bright red where the solution touched her skin.  She started crying and saying that her hands hurt.  I had her wash her hands with cool water but the redness did not subside.   Her hands grew hotter and more red for the next couple hours.  I called the doctor and originally we treated it as an allergic reaction.  The next day her hands  forearms were still red and the redness lasted 3 days eventually turning into a raised scabby / dry  area.   The doctor on the second day decided that it was not an allergic reaction and treated us for a chemical burn.  I tested the PH of the bubble solution and it was lower than 5.5 which was as low as the PH paper would go.  Today I got a PH reader that goes 0-14 and the reading came back at 4.88.
