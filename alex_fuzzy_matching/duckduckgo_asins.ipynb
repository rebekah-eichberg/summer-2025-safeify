She choked initially and just as her dad turned her around to do the Heimlich maneuver, she said it went into her belly. We rushed her to the ER. The doctor did X-rays and decided to try and let it pass. After 3 days more X-rays were done and the spinner had not passed through her stomach. It was decided the spinner needed to come out because it was too big to pass. She was scheduled to have it removed at St. Paul children's hospital with a pediatric GI doctor. They ordeal lasted 5 days and was traumatizing for my daughter (and her parents).",

Both children (8-10 years old) and adults stomped on it with no problems sending the rocket about 200 feet in the air.  An adult friend reloaded the launch pad with the nerf-tipped rocket and I looked at the air bladder I was stomping on and the rocket flew squarely into my eye.  We don't know how it changed its direction other than the fact that the launch pad does swivel.  Neither my brow or cheekbone were struck leaving the full impact on my right eye.  I almost detached my retina.  I had retinal bleeding, a corneal abrasion, blood pooling from some other part of my eye and general blunt force trauma surrounding my eye.  I suffered (and still do) from excessive pressure in that eye and am currently on two medications to keep it lower (traumatic glaucoma).  It's been two months since the accident and my eye is still dilated as a result of the accident which causes me to have to wear sunglasses for using a computer  and causes me to have poorer vision. The headaches I have from the accident are continuing.  While I am thankful this did not happen to one of the children present, it certainly could have.  Most likely my injury is permanent.  I coninue to see my ophthamologist and he could not give me a prognosis.  The box for the toy does not show children wearing safety glasses and the print on the outside of the box under WARNING talks about a choking hazard.  Under warnings on the website, it simply says Do not aim at eyes or face (I did not), and To reduce risk of serious eye injury or blindness:  Do not shoot rockets at others.  Keep bystanders behind the launch pad.",

After posting this incident on a consumer comment board - Buywise.com, an attorney called and was directed to the above mentioned family.   As it turns out, there were several children around the country that were injured from the poor design of the brake wheel on this 4-wheeler. You would think they could design some type of protective cover? Several have lost fingers and one was de-gloved (skin completely removed from hand). The company is choosing to settle with the families but has not done anything to make this product safer.Here is a previously posted situation posted on the CPSRMS public website for this product:Also, for the Razor 4 wheeler, there is a recall for models beginning with the numbers  103110-0 and 103110-02This link has info on how to get the fix for the problem.

         "Retrospective Goods LLC: The report of harm indicates a 7 year old child swallowed Speks “earth magnets and ended up loosing her appendix….” The report goes on to discuss earth magnets that have resulted in serious surgeries, colostomy bags and death. The report of harm incorrectly confuses high powered rare earth magnets with a flux index of more than 50 with products like Speks with a low flux index (less than 50 kG2 mm2). While rare earth magnets with a flux index greater than 50 have been associated with perforations of internal organs when multiple magnets are swallowed, Retrospective Goods is unaware of any perforation of internal organs resulting from ingestion of Speks. This is to be expected because of the low flux index rating of Speks. Speks are marketed and promoted as a product for adults and are not marketed, promoted or sold as a toy for children. The Speks package bears the following warning label:WARNING: Keep Away From All Children! Do not put near or in nose or mouth. Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested.The Get Speks website includes the following warnings: WARNING: Keep Away From All Children! Do not put near or in nose or mouth. Swallowed magnets can pinch and stick together across intestines causing serious injury or death. Seek immediate medical attention if magnets are swallowed or ingested. Although Speks is not marketed, promoted, or intended for children, Speks meet all toy and safety standards for children 3 and older and has a flux index rating significantly less than 50 kG2 mm2.",

Next thing we know he is screaming, his finger was trapped between the neck and head in the bobble head joint. When my husband finally got it free it was so smashed and indented it looked like it was going to fall off. It was bleeding around the nail bed and 30 minutes later black and bruised at the nail bed and his whole finger is swollen, not broken though as he is bending it. He screamed inconsolably for over an hour. I went to Amazon to write a review before I reported it to hopefully stop anyone else and then found FIVE other reviews almost immediately where the same exact thing happened to other people's 7 to 9 month old babies. This is ridiculous and needs to be recalled ASAP.",

My husband and I purchased the product for our older daughter who is 6 well above the manufactures are range for this product. Though the online page was missing a choking hazard warning I took measures to keep them away from my younger daughter. On July 3, 2017 my daughter woke up at at 8am. I fed her breast milk and we both drifted off to sleep. Suddenly my daughter started vomiting profusely all over our bed. I screamed for my hubby and he came running. After she vomited she went back to sleep so my husband went to work and we decided that if our daughter was still vomiting when he got home we would take her to the emergency room. Through out the day [REDACTED] did not seem like herself she was fussy and did not eat. When my hubby got home we took [REDACTED] to the hospital. While there she was given a dose of zofran to try to stop her vomiting. They ordered ct scans and xrays but could not figure out what was causing her vomiting. It was not until it was surgically removed her body that we found out what had been causing our baby to get so sick she swallowed a water bead. These toys meed to be taken off the market.",

There a warning label in fine print which reads, people who are photo sensitive and have had seizures due to flashing lights should consult a doctor before using this toy. There is possibility that photo sensitivity may occur in children who has no history of seizure or epilepsy.  This warning is very difficult to read.The child was taken to the Mayo Emergency hospital in MN by ambulance where she was treated and sent home for further follow up and testing.12/26/13 She contacted the manufacturer through email and requested them to contact her by phone.  She is concerned that this toy has caused her child who has never had a seizure to become vulnerable and she has to be constantly watching her child.  She feels that this toy is a dangerous product and should be taken off the market for children's safety.The product is not part of a recall.",

         "I purchased the Pacific Play Tents Kids One Touch Beach Tent, UV treated - 48 x 48 x 36 from Amazon on 10/1/2016.  There is a mechanism at the top of the tent that is pushed down a center support pole and locks four metal locking supports into place (which in turn connect to the four structural tent rods) in order to set up the tent (i.e. the one touch system).  In order to take the tent back down, per the instructions, the locking supports are supposed to be slowly raised while holding the center rod.  However, the locking supports are released with very little upward force.  After the release is triggered, the four locking supports thrust upward along the center pole quickly and with great force.  There is no safety stop in place in order to prevent the center mechanism from sliding up the center pole to the top of the tent, where it is then pressed firmly against the top plastic piece that connects the four tent rods.  This puts anyone (child or adult) at risk of having fingers or skin pinched and/or crushed in between the center mechanism and the top plastic piece.   The date of the incident was 10/31/2017.  The tent was set up in our family room.  My two-year-old son was able to pull the tent down on to its side, access and release the center support mechanism.  His left thumb became caught/pinched between the center support mechanism and the top plastic piece.  He was in great pain and unable to release his thumb from the tent. My wife and I were afraid to push the center support back down the center pole for fear that it could increase the pinching force on his thumb.  Ultimately I unscrewed some of the screws in the center mechanism, and it released.  The tip of my son's thumb was pinched very hard.  It appeared disfigured and was nearly crushed.  We took him to urgent care and had it evaluated.  Thankfully, he did not lose any part of his thumb.  However, had we not reacted quickly to dissemble the mechanism, I have no doubt his thumb could have been severely permanently damaged and/or at risk of needing partial amputation.  There is also a review on Amazon (which I did not read until after this incident) detailing a similar incident involving an adult whose finger was crushed by this tent in the same manner.  I am reporting this hoping it will prevent any further injuries from this unsafe product that is marketed as a tent for children.",
