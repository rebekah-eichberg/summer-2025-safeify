Adults put it together.  Both children (8-10 years old) and adults stomped on it with no problems sending the rocket about 200 feet in the air.  An adult friend reloaded the launch pad with the nerf-tipped rocket and I looked at the air bladder I was stomping on and the rocket flew squarely into my eye.  We don't know how it changed its direction other than the fact that the launch pad does swivel.  Neither my brow or cheekbone were struck leaving the full impact on my right eye.  I almost detached my retina.  I had retinal bleeding, a corneal abrasion, blood pooling from some other part of my eye and general blunt force trauma surrounding my eye.  I suffered (and still do) from excessive pressure in that eye and am currently on two medications to keep it lower (traumatic glaucoma).

There is a mechanism at the top of the tent that is pushed down a center support pole and locks four metal locking supports into place (which in turn connect to the four structural tent rods) in order to set up the tent (i.e. the one touch system).  In order to take the tent back down, per the instructions, the locking supports are supposed to be slowly raised while holding the center rod.  However, the locking supports are released with very little upward force.  After the release is triggered, the four locking supports thrust upward along the center pole quickly and with great force.  There is no safety stop in place in order to prevent the center mechanism from sliding up the center pole to the top of the tent, where it is then pressed firmly against the top plastic piece that connects the four tent rods.  This puts anyone (child or adult) at risk of having fingers or skin pinched and/or crushed in between the center mechanism and the top plastic piece.   The date of the incident was 10/31/2017.  The tent was set up in our family room.  My two-year-old son was able to pull the tent down on to its side, access and release the center support mechanism.  His left thumb became caught/pinched between the center support mechanism and the top plastic piece.  He was in great pain and unable to release his thumb from the tent. My wife and I were afraid to push the center support back down the center pole for fear that it could increase the pinching force on his thumb.  Ultimately I unscrewed some of the screws in the center mechanism, and it released.  The tip of my son's thumb was pinched very hard.  It appeared disfigured and was nearly crushed.  We took him to urgent care and had it evaluated.  Thankfully, he did not lose any part of his thumb.  However, had we not reacted quickly to dissemble the mechanism, I have no doubt his thumb could have been severely permanently damaged and/or at risk of needing partial amputation.
